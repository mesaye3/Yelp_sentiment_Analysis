I'm a big fan of the sashimi don and always quite happy with it. Instead of big pieces of fish, there are some chopped and some are in pieces, the torched butterfish is one of one absolute favourite, buttery and smoky with fried garlic on top as garnish added some texture to it. The octopus is also great touch, add bite to the dish. I like the variety of this dish and according to the chef and what is available it subject to change so it is a pleasant surprise what you end up getting. The sushi lunch is pretty great as well. Grab a friend or co-worker to share a couple of different dishes. It is nice to go early for lunch since they normally take lunch break around 2:30pm.",0,0,0

I left and found the fine folks at the UPS next to Smith's on E. Flamingo.  Every single time I've been in there (always, always, always) it's a great experience - the staff is A+, the service spot on, and they play excellent music (60's and 70's) in the background.

It's also nice because you don't smell too much like kimchi afterwards. However, they do not offer sushi\/rolls on weekends, which I thought was weird.

Jun's special was pretty good and very filling; it comes with bulgogi, grilled chicken, kalbi, mandu, and fried pork. My favorite is definitely the kalbi tang. It's not too salty, but still flavorful. I prefer my soups not too salty and msg-free. The meat is very tender and the broth is delicious. I will definitely be back for more kalbi tang.",2,0,1

Yum is all I can say!!  Walking in to a grand foyer to be greeted by friendly hostess' and a minimal wait for the hibachi!  SO we mosied on over to the bar and made the decision to hit the mai tai!  Something fantastical about that drink!  LOL...  Once we made it to the hibachi grill the waitress took our order,being vegan I asked if they would be able to avoid the egg in the rice, once I said that she immediately offered all suggestions for me to eat!  I was shocked at the offering, usually not a normal approach from the wait staff!!  The MISO soup was by far the most flavorful that I've ever had!  It was flavor explosion in my mouf! (that's right... I called it a mouf)...  The vegetables with tofu were phenomenal as well and the pricing was moderate, moderate high, but for two full meals and a round of drinks for half the gaggle (two people) it was right on key... about 50 bucks or so!

It would have lasted even longer but I couldn't handle the regrowth anymore and removed it myself. There was not a single chip, crack, or imperfection in the polish and THAT my friends, is 5-star. The tech did a great job on prepping my fingers and cuticles, and she also put sunscreen on the backs of my hands before putting me under the UV light with the gel, and I've never seen that before. I liked the gesture.

The salon is spotless, and while the layout is different than anything I've seen it lends itself well to a feeling of classiness. The nail stations are side by side along a huge granite counter, so if it's busy you WILL be right next to someone else. Fortunately everyone I met was really nice and unobtrusive. The pedis are done in other room adjacent to the nail bar. They also offer other spa services, but I haven't tried those...yet.

I was offered a neck massage when I sat down, but the people who perform those services are offering separate from your nail experience, so if you accept you need to pay for it. I declined because I was on my lunch break and didn't want to go back to work with massage oil\/lotion on my neck and in my hair. The girl next to me accepted and it looked like a great massage though.

The only reason I give this nail spa 4 stars instead of five is because I didn't get any kind of hand massage or moisturizing treatment. When the gel mani was done curing (or whatever it does), she just handed me the bill. I wasn't upset but it was strange that I went to my car and immediately needed to put lotion on my hands myself. 

I believe I paid $30\/$35 with tip for the whole thing and while it's a little pricey it was worth the long wear I got out of it.",1,1,1

I've always wanted to stop there, but never any time. So when my fiance's best friend (who lives in Vegas) said we should go here I was instantly happy. And it was even better than I had imagined. 
    When I walked in I felt as though I had walked in to a restaurant in Italy. The decor was funny, like an Italian version of TGIF. But it only added to the whole experience. We wound up spending WAY too much for three people and getting WAY WAY too much food, too. But it was VERY much worth it. The food was awesome. And the quantity was huge. Although it seems a little ridiculous for them to charge $2 for a side of marinara sauce when we just got two $11 appetizers...but hey that's a fancy place for you. Had we ordered one dish and one appetizer I think we would have been perfect...but when your in Vegas you go big or go home. 
     This restaurant is perfect for any size party and for any occasion. The staff is very friendly, and pretty prompt. There selection is great, as well. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.",0,0,0

Bland, amateur, sub-par: just a few of the adjectives that come to mind in describing the service and the ""gelato"". While it may do for the average tourist consumer, this icy mush would leave an Italian shaking his head...or gagging.

The Patio was great, very pretty.  Our server was nice and fairly attentive.  I love the interior of the restaurant too though, so I think that would have been nice as well.

For the food:
The Samosa appetizer, while good flavor, was a little on the greasy side.  The baba was great.  The dinner...way over-priced and small portion.  I ordered an Indian dish, and in my experience the plate comes heaping full with your entree and then there is a small side of rice.  This dish came heaping w\/ white rice that wasn't cooked appropriately (I'm sorry, if my rice is crunching it isn't done.) and a very small portion of the Cauliflower curry.  Cauliflower is cheap people, for $15 I expect more than 1 c. of veggies.

That's when we get every flavor of rum and mix it in a blas then put a half inch of OJ on top. Mmmm......
 They have a wide variety of things I don't see anywhere else.  Baron Jaeger, a honey flavored, belly warming, yummy shot. Tastes like pure honey.
 There are many others, you'll have to wander and see what grabs your eye and yells ""PUT ME IN YOUR MOUTH!"".
 Aisles are just wide enough yo get a cart through, employees aren't over the top friendly, I imagine they deal with a lot through a shift so I cut them a little slack.

I thought the restaurant itself was ok - their blasting ac was a nice escape from the summer heat. Seats were really padded and super comfy. I thought it was cute that they had their condiment bottles in old 6pack carriers. 

I got the lobster salad roll for $7.99 I didn't expect too much for the price and it wasn't the best, but wasn't bad. The bread was good - perfectly buttered and toasted, he said they just started shipping the rolls in from I think maine? So like I said, they do care and they are trying. 

I love that they had crinkle fries, I'm sick of this whole shoestring fries thing so many places have going on. Crinkle fries remind me of elementary school lunch - the star of every craptastic meal. Also had the fried scallop appetizer $7 or $8 I can't remember. They were pretty good - a decent portion, hand breaded w panko. They may need to change their oil because it had a weird after-taste like old oil. 

I'm honestly not sure that I'll be back. They've been open long enough to work out the kinks, but the reviews are mostly the same - ok but not great when this is a place specializing in lobster.",0,0,0

I had dinner here on Wednesday night and absolutely loved it. The salads are perfect, and the pizza is just incredible - wood fired with a lot of unique toppings (potato, clams, etc.). The pizzas are the perfect size for two to share, and leave you just enough room to try their eclectic appetizers.

Beautiful atmosphere at night. I'm not sure how other reviewers are calling it casual? I haven't heard of too many 5-star pizzerias - this is about as nice as they come... It's definitely a pizzeria and wine bar, with lots of wine to choose from, and really a nice bar area for happy hour.

They also have a climate controlled patio which is gonna pay off in the summer. The chairs and stools may be the most comfortable my bum has landed on.

I read all the reviews previous to my stay and was worried I wasn't going to have a good time due to all the negative feedback that was left. Well that was not the case. The staff at the check in counter was friendly and welcoming. I was on the 23rd floor which are the newly renovated rooms. Very clean and neat. No complains what so ever regarding the room. The only complain I do have was the parking and the people who clean the rooms. To start off, the parking was a hassle to get in and out after it was charged to my room because the activation never went through all the times it was activated. It was a hassle having to phone in the front desk in the parking structure to let me out. On to the next problem which really made me mad. I had took some individual sized chip bags that I took for my son. Well the person who cleaned our room took some of my sons chips. I know this because the big bag were they were stored was open which I left closed before we left to walk the strip. Pretty sad if you ask me. But overall, hotel is good.

It has been many years since I visited L'express, and I went with a bit of nervousness as I have such great memories there.  Thankfully they lived up to my memories once again!

I had a very simple lunch of pot au feu, which was perfect in every way.  The beef was incredibly tender, the carrots were the perfect consistency, the cabbage was not overdone, the chicken was tender and flavourful, and they even included a bone with marrow.  I love marrow - it is the ultimate comfort food for me, and was a lovely addition!  It came very simply presented with the usual baguette with a nice butter, a side of mustard and a big pot of cornichon.  Simple.  Delicious.  Perfect!

I followed with my favourite dessert from many years ago, the iles flottantes.  Still just as good!  A huge fresh perfectly fluffy meringue had a beautiful caramelized crunchy coating which had a few almond slices to enhance the flavour.  This was served on a perfect creme anglaise which had just the right amount of vanilla flavour.  This lived up to my memories!

I love this spot, and am so happy to know it is still just as good!",11,6,10

I have watched them for several years, well before they were an MLS franchise. All this time later I decided to take my little girl to her first professional match. 

Stade Saputo is a fine soccer facility. I have sat in 3 different sections and the sight lines are great practically anywhere you sit. My daughter enjoyed the ruckus created by the UM's and hopefully I will be able to be in that section next time. It is not necessarily family ""unfriendly"" but I have to do my inner hooligan justice and sing the chants standing up. 

Montréal is coming along as a club, they defeated Real Salt Lake 3-2 off of an injury time winner by Matthew Ferrari. The atmosphere was ridiculous and my daughter cheered like crazy, she genuinely fed off of the energy of the crowd. Once I caught a paper streamer for her, her evening was complete.

Came during the week for lunch. We ordered the garlic pakoras as out apps. My goodness, the sauce on them, spicy and sweet. I couldn't get enough! Highly recommend those.  The hot and sour soup is always a hit or miss in my experience and this time it was well done, very spicy. I got the chili chicken as my main and it was very saucy. If you like your chili chicken with gravy to be very saucy, then by all means go for it. It was very delicious and not too salty. Of course there was a ridiculous amount of rice to fill you up. The rest of my group got the Bombay chicken. They were impressed and said it was like a creamy tandoori sauce.

I am giving it 5 stars as the best in the Phoenix area, but not yet on equal footing with other 5 star breweries in Portland, San Diego and Colorado.  But way so much better quality than other Phoenix area brews I've been served (e.g. Four Peaks and San Tan brewing).

* The tasting room\/brewery is an industrial park setting (all good breweries have this quality).  
*  The tasting room was pretty large with lots of seating which was great.  
*  They offer flights of their own brews served on a cool ""lazy susan wheel"", and cost for a flight was super reasonable.
*  They offer interesting guest micro-brews to try out as well

The house brews I tried were all good quality.  My tasting notes are below (your mileage may vary):
* That'll Do IPA - their first IPA and very traditional tasting West Coast IPA flavors... very good.
* Magic in the Ivy - is a hoppy ale, not really an IPA, but the hops give it a good flavor and very sessionable at only 5.6% ABU
* Amarillo IPA - not as good as the That'll Do, but fresh tasting
* Das Alt Folks - is an Alt Bier \/ Amber, which was easy drinking and new craft beer drinkers should start with this one
Scottsdale Blonde - is a Kolsch style light beer.... easy drinking for the light beer fans
* Rice Pudding Porter - this was one of my favs.... has some good flavors with vanilla, but with the cloves it makes it more of a one pint experience for me compared to other porters.
*  Snowbird Imperial Stout - has a strong high alcohol kick to it at the end, like a whiskey barrel taste.  Good for a winter warmer, but beware of this one as it is 9%+

The bartender\/owner was super cool, and I like that they have a good relationship with Mike Hess brewing from San Diego (Hess + Huss both equal good beer).  I hope they do a collaboration brew some time.

A no frills diner with comfort food all for the affordable price of $4.95...

Ordered the smoky burger paired with soup . Wife had the fish tacos and had poutine with maple bacon for appys. 

Burger was great. Not dry. Moist and juicy and portion was awesome. Cheese was perfectly melted. Only thing negative was the bun. In vancouver, they use brioche bun.which was lightly oiled and toasted. Here, it was more like $ store bun. Very dry and stale. I ended up not eating the bread. But the patty was seasoned well and everything else came together. 

The soup tho tasted weird...it was like a mix.of grits.and cream soup.and garnished with chinese green onions!! So weird!  Maybe the chef was trying a fusion.of some.sort...but let me tell you...it did not work. 

Fish tacos were awesome. Fish was perfectly breaded and tasty and came with a wedge of lime. The salsa and veggies accompanying the taco filling all complemented the dish. 

The poutine was awesome. Fries nice and crispy...curds were aplenty and creamy...maple bacon was generously sprinkled on top. The sweetness of the maple and saltiness of the bacon...complemented the gravy curds and fries magically. Definitely a must have. 

Service was great. Iit was quick and spot on

However, I have given up on you Maki Sushi.

I came here with my friend, excited and reminiscing about my sweet sixteen dinner I had here, hoping to be served the same delicious hand rolls and tempura from back in the day. I was surely disappointed. The second we stepped in and walked by all the disappointed faces in a sea of leftover sushi platters and half eaten tempura messes left on the table, we realized we made a mistake coming here. There were people waiting for their bill or for their food for far too long, and you could feel the tension in the room. The server was stressed out, juggling too many tables for one person. Nevertheless, we dismissed all those things and decided to just order and try to enjoy our time here.

We ordered a variety of sushi rolls, hand rolls, tempura and soups. Lets just say that even Loblaws sushi was better than this. The rice on the sushi rolls were inadequately portioned, dripping in soy sauce, containing minimal vegetables and cold shrimp (why are they skimping out on white rice??) The wasabi and ginger on the side was also missing.The shrimp tempura was not fresh, had a slight fishy smell to it. The batch we ordered was not piping hot and the sauce for it came after we were done eating it. 

We ended our sushi experience on very average mango ice cream. The service wasn't too bad, waiters were scattered at times, but luckily, we didn't wait too long for our bill.

But the Bellagio did not really impress as a whole. I suppose it is too much to expect premium service (while paying premium prices!) at a resort when its mission is predicated on quantity over quality, but the reception we received at the front desk was really shockingly indifferent and rude. I found the reception area and front desk to be a morass of chaos and confusion at all hours of the day (even midweek!). And the property itself, though not without its charms, is aging. Our standard deluxe room was surprisingly roomy...it was as large as some junior suites we have stayed in. The decor was nice, understated and tasteful. The bathroom was quite luxurious, with a separate shower and tub, and acres of travertine and granite. Nevertheless, although the toilet had some sort of turbo-jet flush (I swear I was almost sucked in!), the water pressure in the shower was poor. To compound matters, the shower head was leaking from its attachment at the pipe and so water was sprayed everywhere on the ceiling and out to the floor. The shower head also was half-clogged with mineral deposits, so no more than a trickle of water was coming out. A call to maintenance quickly addressed this, however. I must say the phone operators, etc were quite courteous and helpful, in contrast to the front desk. What was particularly annoying was a strong whistling sound through the windows (we were only on the 10th floor, but it was particularly windy during our stay). When I brought this up to the front desk, I was first met with apathy, then a ""we can't do anything so you should suck it up"" attitude.

But I am not going to complain for it being a little more on the healthier side. The service was great. I was greeted with smiles and was helped with menu options seeing it was my first time. The cookies are also a must try I had the chocolate chunk and the chunks were huge. They have a healthier version of soda that was delicious.

It's also conveniently located on the way to downtown Phoenix, just south of the I-10, to and from my way to work.  But, the layout of the parking lot makes this one of the most inconvenient gas stations to fill up at.

First problem;  There's only four pumps, all of which are located in the corner of the lot.  If there's one car using the pumps on either side, it's a major challenge to drive around them.  If the only free pump is facing the wrong way for your gas tank, maneuvering around the parking lot to face the right way is also a tough challenge.  Plus, on at least one occasion, another driver swooped in and stole my pump while I was trying to do this.  You really have to get lucky, or make some very quick decisions about how to enter the gas station while you're driving towards it.

Second problem;  The tiny parking lot.  I understand that space is limited, but between the gas situation, and people trying to pick up a drink or a snack from the shop, just driving to a parking space can be a headache.

Third problem;  Ghetto.  I'm a 32 year old man and I am uncomfortable stopping by this Circle K when the sun is not out.  The location is being renovated, but that doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of seedy people hanging around this part of town.",1,1,1

But on this trip - my viewpoint changed. Where you stay determines the overall crowd, and a young, hip one is what we wanted. The Flamingo sure ain't that. Granted, it didn't stop us from meeting tons of like-minded people ... just not in our hotel.

The price was OK (about $125 a night for this particular weekend), but looking back, it would have been totally worth it to spend just a little more and stay at Planet Hollywood or the Cosmopolitan. Lesson learned.

The Flamingo has two main selling points - their badass, central location on the Strip, and a Margaritaville on site. Otherwise - the rooms are just ok, the front desk doesn't provide even the smallest of comforts (I called for a toothbrush when my  bag was delayed, they told me to go buy one), internet was overpriced, no minibars in the rooms and the crow was pretty lowbrow.

I had the pleasure of eating at Dakota twice during my stay in Scottsdale, the first time was on the day I first arrived and the hotel staff at the Aloft recommended it for a healthy lunch. When I arrived it was empty so I saddled up and took a seat at the bar. The bartender was super nice and I could tell he was bummed that I wasn't drinking. But he made some solid reccos and I ended up going with the Kale salad. 

The Kale salad was EXCELLENT, for only $11 a massive pile of green kale leaves were tossed with romaine lettuce, golden raisins, toasted almonds, quinoa, parmesan cheese with shallots and a lemon vinegarette dressing. It was hearty\/filling, light and fresh (plus once I added grilled chicken it totally helped me to hit all my macros perfectly). 10\/10

A couple of days later our group returned after having filled out an order in advance so the food would all arrive at the same time. For this meal, I went with the Steak sandwich and made the silly un-health-conscious mistake of ordering the rosemary fries in place of the salad I should've ordered. I imagine this sandwich is usually quite good but ordered in a group setting it fell flat. The bun was soggy the steak inside luke warm. The flavours were all there but this little sandy had been left out in the cold a bit too long and had gotten rather sickly. The fries were ridiculous, but how can you go wrong with garlic and herb covered fries really. Overall this dish fell a little flat based on its end execution - I mean fries shouldn't have to be the saviours of the dish. 6\/10

Dakota is a massive space, almost too big to be a restaurant, but seeing as it's a hot night spot in the evenings it all makes sense - although I didn't get to experience the nighttime shenanigans! 

Overall a 4\/5, their food is definitely made with love, the group of 20+ just hurt the execution this time around

Pasha Cafe is an alternative to the 3 Subways, 2 Starbucks and the countless sandwich shops in the area. 

Pasha Cafe offers reasonably priced Mediterranean food, such as falafel, shwarma, gyros, grape leaves, along with hookah every night. The falafel is moist, even though not made fresh, but the wrap tastes good for what you pay for. Sometimes one of the workers will ask you to pick from one of the pickled vegetables (turnips or carrots? I don't know about you guys, but I always thought you get all of them); other times not so. What motivates me to write about this place isn't the food, even though that's decent, or the hookah, which I am too much of a germophobe to try, but instead the personal, I mean REALLY PERSONAL customer service here.

One day, while on lunch break, I came in to order just a basic falafel wrap and a soda. The owner with the glasses and receding hairline made my sandwich, accompanying it with compliments directed towards me. I smiled and nodded. I just wanted to get this uncomfortable encounter over with so I can dive into my food. Well, as I was paying, he leaned in. I thought ""oh okay he's leaning in to shake my hand. Maybe he's thanking me for coming in here."" Then he got closer. ~cue Jaws music~ Alright maybe he is going to whisper something into my ear? Nope. This complete stranger kisses me on the cheek without any warning. Yeah it's a nice gesture, but when you're a 20 something year old getting a cheek kiss from a 50 something year old, I can't help but think something is a bit off.

1) My partner had three wisdom teeth (two impacted) removed here about 4 weeks ago, and Dr. Bruno Girard was absolutely amazing with us. After freezing, which took half an hour, he popped out the three teeth and had it all stitched up within 30 minutes. After prescriptions and aftercare instructions, he took the time to sit with us to address any concerns, as well as talk about what should be expected in the next few days. Dr. Girard then texted us his number. If that wasn't impressive enough, he texted that same evening, and 7 days later to see how his handiwork was. 

2) Having just moved from Vancouver, I'm in need of all new health related services. Came here based on the reviews on yelp for general dentist and my partner's experience, and I was definitely not disappointed. 
Reception was friendly and efficient. Didn't wait for more than 5 minutes after checking in.
Dentist (a younger woman who had just signed on full time at this practice- forgot her name already! But there's only one) was friendly and very thorough with the exam. She kindly answered all our questions, and even elaborated on preventative measures that could be taken.

The facility is clean- like all dentists should be (of course!), but of note, each patient is placed in an isolated (albeit, door-less) room. I really appreciated the privacy, as I think should be with all medical appointments.

- Vet is extremely kind and clearly knows his stuff (I think it's Dr. Ackerman? as noted in other reviews).

- There's a cat at reception that is friendly - *but be forewarned if you have a dog that doesn't like cats. 

Cons:
- Apparently it's one of the pricier vets in Toronto and they will charge you a fee for transfer of records.
- Long wait time (probably because the Vet takes his time with each client! So it could be a pro)
- Parking is around the corner and metered - sort of a pain.
- It might be a fluke, but I never received a reminder for a check-up for my cats, which I think is unusual.

We were seated in the back corner and given plenty of space for our party which was nice, considering it was primetime on a Saturday night.

That was pretty much when the good things I have to say about the restaurant end. Our server, from beginning to end, was slow. I would post his name, but I don't know if that's against Yelp rules. I ordered a honey dijon chicken sandwich with french fries. The fries were mediocre at best (not hot, plain tasting) and the sandwich was pretty poor. I don't know how you can screw up grilled chicken, cheese, bacon and honey dijon sauce. The bottom of the bun was completely soggy and the sandwich as a whole was bland. Our guest of honor (the birthday girl) ordered a steak which she had to return because it was almost raw inside. She had asked for medium well. Several members of our group DID, however, like their food.

Going back to the service, several members of our party waited several minutes for drink refills. Also, we had to flag our waiter down for our checks after waiting close to (if not more than) 20 minutes. Even after we gave him our checks and credit cards, he took close to another 10 minutes to bring them back. 

Our best guess is that he knew he was adding an 18% gratuity to our checks because of our party size, so he took his time doing everything. I seriously considered crossing out the 18% and leaving 10% and noting on the tab that the service didn't warrant the 18%, but in the end, I opted against it.

However, the store appears in disarray with boxes everywhere.  Maybe it is the feeling of contention that troubles me with tight aisles and end caps cascading into the walk space (I feel claustrophobic just writing about it).  While the staff is helpful and knowledgeable, the checkout is awkward with never enough registers open.  Cannot they smile more and seem happy?  After all, wine is the elixir of life!

As a Reserve Member I have attended a few of their invitation only wine events.  For the most part, other than the samplings, improvements are needed.  Lackluster food and poor presentations don't inspire me to attend them any longer.  

For all the hype of membership and points, etc., I cannot see where their ""discounts"" are anything more than Harris Teeter grants on a weekly basis (ouch, yes, that one hurt).

My boyfriends birthday is only a few days after mine and we usually end up at the keg for my boyfriends birthday dinner and have never been upset in the least! Drinks are kept full, staff are courteous and thoughtful, they make pleasurable small talk that meets the mood of the table, they don't ask you how the food is when you have only just out the first bite in your mouth, they make sure you don't need anything else!  Yesterday I was at the keg for my birthday and I had the blue cheese filet along with the escargot.  I really enjoyed both platters! The mashed potatoes were perfectly creamy and fluffy, the meat was cooked perfectly for me (medium) and the food was the perfect temperature.

The lot was pretty bare on a Saturday night after 8pm, so we were kinda wary but we were also really hungry. It also looked like it was closed since the windows are heavily blacked out with curtains, we had to look for their Hours Sign and saw they were open till 2am.

The decor inside is nice but has a club feel to it, the bar was closed for a private party when we arrived. There is a live DJ, but I think he was busy DJ'ing for the private party (which kinda got annoying because there would be a boom of music that was hard on the ears then it'd get turned down real low... not sure if that was the DJ or the private party messing around with the music), and the main dining room where we were seated was pretty empty. We had a large group of 6, and were seated ASAP though! The lighting is really dim (but looking at photos it looks well-lit??), and small candles are placed in the center of each table for ambiance. Menus were kinda hard to read in the dim light so it took a bit to be able to read everything.

What confused me was the items listed on the menu. The place is Asian Fusion\/Thai, but there were things merged with Indian, Korean, Chinese, and Japanese food too. I know it's ""Asian Fusion"" but... when the menu is half a sheet of paper, I would have expected more plate options with the listed cultures I mentioned previously. Has a really nice list of vegetarian items, but when you're Asian, your diet is practically vegetarian, haha!

So we ended up ordering almost half the menu since, being Asians, we always order in large amounts to share with everyone! We ordered:

Bacon wrapped lychee (those who ate it said they would have preferred a fresh lychee as opposed to a dried lychee), bacon wrapped okra (those who ate it said it was good), oden noodles with bean sauce (eh, staple Asian dish), korean bbq (still sizzling hot in the pan), shrimp curry (which was really runny, had no flavor, random pineapple in it? and the spicy heat overpowered the dish), flat rice noodles (weird gummy, chewy texture, this is supposed to be like the Korean rice noodles ""topokki"" but they're not supposed to be gummy or chewy), fried tofu in some sauce (I missed the name of it, but it's fried tofu, can't go wrong there!), potstickers (eh, you can't really screw up potsickers, they're a pretty simple and staple dish in any Asian restaurant), and the sugar cane pork (sugar cane absorbed all the liquid from the pork, so the meat was dry, and I felt like I should be eating it in wonton soup instead).

Everything was ehhh OK, the portions are really meant for 1 person, not to really share with a large group, but we wanted to try everything that sounded interesting to us! But really, the price we paid we honestly could have gone to an Asian restaurant and for the same price get huge heaps of food on plates to share.

Sochu House staff was really friendly, our waiter was attentive and gave us great explanation on things we were curious about, but other than that, this place wasn't really a home run for us and we probably won't be back. Sorry!",3,0,1

Their dulce de leche filling is a pretty good compromise since it pairs so well with the flavours of the churro.

She explains treatment options in such great detail with all the processes and outcomes. Then she leaves it to your decision.

I thought it was safe bc they had a good number of positive reviews and clients seemed generally satisfied. The mistake I made was not reading through each review. MOST of he positive feedback is for their spa, not their salon. My hair was cut with a dull razor and the stylist was pulling on my head for 45 mins. It was noticeably uneven, even after I said something and she cut some of the longer side. She never even showed me the back of it, which I realized after the fact was because she cut one side different from the other. She tried to style it but couldn't get the flat iron to cooperate so she just left it, brushing one side completely out. It looked so bad I just wanted to get out of there. I bit the bullet and went to a more expensive salon to get it fixed, negating the whole benefit of even buying a groupon in the first place. Save yourself a headache and don't go here.",7,0,0

I was changing my hair from a medium brown to blonde sombre to red and I wanted to make sure there would be grey coverage since I had noticed a few. 

I brought several pictures on my phone of what type of red I wanted. She barely glanced at them but seemed very confident in the idea of what I wanted so I wasn't worried. She asked if I was okay with my hair still having the ombre effect but in red tones since my ends were so light. I was fine with this and we moved forward to the coloring.

The color processing took forever. Maybe thats normal for red? I don't know but I know I sat and watched a cooking show begin and end and another begin and get about halfway before she decided we were ready to rinse the color.

This was where it got bad. She was audibly worried as soon as she started to rinse and asked me how long it had been since I colored my hair. I told her it had been about 4-5 months since my naturall color blended into the ombre well. She then let me know that she had no idea my roots were my natural undyed hair and because of this they had come out a bit ""hot"". Once I got to the mirror I saw that ""hot"" meant cheeto orange even while still wet. I don't know why she assumed I would come to get my hair cut and dyed with absolutely zero growth, especially when I had expressed concern about covering greys.

She assured me it was fixable and reapplied the color and I again processed for 30-45 minutes. The end result was still bright roots that were noticably lighter than the rest of the color and an average cut. The stylist I'm now seeing elsewhere was pretty horrified but the dye job. She said she assumed I had done it myself with box color. 

Lacy was completely oblivious to the fact I was unhappy with the color and actually took an appointment for another cut while I was processing, which I hate. Looking at the other reviews it seems like this place worked out great for some and the decor was nice but I would definitely choose a stylist other than Lacy.",2,0,0

The room is beautiful. Wood and brick with dim lighting. Very busy on a Friday night, I suggest you make a reservation. 

The service was pretty good. Friendly server who accommodated our request for a white whine by the glass that is typically by the bottle. I agree with some other yelpers that the by the glass wine selection could have been broader--it's a WINE BAR. But I had 2 very nice glasses of red. A Brunello and a Pinot Noir so I can't complain. 

To eat we had:
Margarita pizza - good but tasted more like a plain cheese pizza with a few basil leaves on top. 
Arugala salad with mushroom and parmesan cheese - tasted how it sounds. I was a fan.
Chicken Parmesan - this was disappointing. 
Pasta with light cream sauce and porcini mushrooms with chicken added - it was very tasty. 
Branzino- this was the fish special. It was fine. Nothing special, nothing offensive. it came with squash blossoms. 
Nutella pizza for desert which was ok. 
The bread they bring to the table is very tasty but could be warmer.

I suggest sticking with the pizza and pasta here.

The painkiller oh man yeah I didn't get the dole whip but was excited that it came with it. The rum in it made it much better. Such an adult drink with the rum and dole whip. You can actually taste the nutmeg but didn't know it would be in there. I would recommend this as one of the drinks you should try.

However, our visit tonight was completely different due to the attitude of a server.  We always come for happy hour because we have three small children and want to avoid the crowds that generally come out later than that.  We were seated and then asked about happy hour items and were told that their crisps were recently taken off happy hour.  No problem, but the waitress went back and forth with us on if we were going to get them three times.  After we got our final no to the crisps and made our order for the sausage rolls she asked if that was all we wanted in a strange fashion as if it almost bothered her that that was all we were going to order and then she hastily ran off when we were still trying to order.  My husband then multiple times tried to get her attention so that we could order, once looking her in the face telling her that we wanted to continue to place our order.  He then got her attention for the last time and she finally came over.  We ordered the Irish stew and yet again she asked if that was all we were going to order.  We order things as we go depending on how we feel, as we do not like to waste food.  There were not that many tables for her to wait on, so I don't understand the constant awkwardness with the question of whether or not we were going to spend more or not.  At this point I told my husband that the situation was getting too awkward for me and that I just wanted to try to come back another day when that waitress would not be there.  My husband then spoke to the bartender\/manager about the situation and he said that we could leave if we wanted to, but that he was going to speak with her.  As we were attempting to depart our waitress comes up to us and tries to discuss the situation of her behavior with us and says that she can sit us with another waitress that has just come on.  In all our years of eating out, I have never come across any business that would allow their employees to behave in this manner.  Had the manager come up and offered us a new waitress we may have been willing to stay, but the problem waitress herself coming over to discuss her attitude took the cake.  At that point we notified the new waitress that we couldn't feel comfortable eating there at that point, although she did seem very nice, our original waitress ruined any chance of that happening.  Sad, because this was our absolute favorite restaurant to eat at up until this point.  My husband is 100% Irish and he felt that this place was well up to par on food, but disgustingly terrible for the service.

I have gone to this location many times and for many years, as it was minutes from where I used to live. I marveled at the rude service time and time again, but gave some excuse to how busy the restaurant was at the time (particularly if it is only open on the bar side). There was one day, however, that aside from myself and my husband there were only two other customers in the shop. My husband asked for his cheese combo to be made only with one type of cheese--as he had done countless times--and the waiter refused, saying it was impossible and touting he had worked there for 15 years and he knew what they could make. He told us that we had never been served that sandwich in that way. He tried to retract and communicate as humans do, but he couldn't pull it off for long. The waiter continued to be gruff and sharp until we were mercifully given our food that was ordered as carry out. 

In my opinion, there's no reason for their staff to behave in such a way. It makes for an unpleasant experience and the story I relayed to you above makes me think that their behavior is a result of the lack of service skills since it even appears when the shop isn't busy.

Unless you are coming in for a special visit (as many do because of food related shows), I suggest the Oakland location where the staff is consistently friendly.",0,1,0

#1 - Waited in line to order from the menu posted by the register. Got to the register and learned that menu was only for people sitting at tables. Got a table.

#3 - Burger arrives. Unfortunately, it is delivered to the person sitting across from me. About five minutes later we get this sorted out and the plate is passed to me. Nothing like a cold burger served to someone else first.

#4 - Waitress asked if I would like more water. I said yes. No water ever came.

#5 - I asked at least three servers for assistance with paying my bill. They each told me they couldn't do that for me. Finally someone came to do that and was very rushed and unfriendly.

Food....was hit or miss. We ordered the Charcuterie platter which was pretty good.  Black hoof's was more tasty however presentation at crush was sublime and it was served with cripy french bread slices so that you can make crostinis.  I ordered the striploin and my date ordered the scallops. I had a piece of the scallops and they were overly salty. As for my steak, it was flavorless with a funny smell to the meat topped with a citrus garnish (prob to hide the funky smell of the meat).  It was one of the worst steaks I've ever had at a trendy resto.  Very underwhelming....for $35, you just expect much more.  I ordered my steak medium rare and most of the time, it should be crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside, but it tasted like a hunk of raw meat that was not juicy nor flavorful - my worst nightmare come true.  My dish was served overtop green beans and sauteed king mushrooms. The green beans were decent and the mushrooms were just ok.  The whole thing was topped with shredded curly deep fried potato strings.  

The waiter recommended a white wine which was decent and the service was top notch.

The damage was $77 per person including tax and tip.  I could say I've had better meals for that price however for the ambiance, it was well worth it.

The blockage was removed, a cleanout that I did not ask for was installed for $2,300.

I contacted the owner who appeared shocked the insurance had made a determination without his invoice sent.  I was more shocked that after 2 weeks he had not sent his invoice.  He did send the invoice to the insurance company, (the same invoice I had provided).  The insurance reiterated that they appropriate amount had been paid.

I'm from Youngstown, Ohio where this ice cream chain originated not 10-20 years ago, but 70 years ago. Because I've been eating this ice cream since the 80s, this ice cream is my standard and what I use to compare everything else.

As far as their service procedure, one person is at the window and he\/she takes your order, makes it, and cashes you out. Everything is made when ordered, including hand packing the pints and quarts. There are no seating  areas aside from a few benches. This is the way it's done at the original Handel's on Market and Midlothian in which you go and wait at least 15-20 minutes in line and you eat ice cream inside or outside your car. Should they continue this procedure like it's 1945? Absolutely not and hopefully they'll make some changes. For now, just be prepared for the wait and to enjoy your ice cream somewhere else beside a table or bench.

I made an appointment with Heather and am sooooo glad I took the plunge. She truly knows what she is doing. My brows look better than they ever have. She really takes her time and pays attention to what she is doing. I asked for advice on filling them in too with a little pencil and she showed me exactly what to do. Thank you Heather!,0,0,0

Let's see 2 seniors and 1 adult (me) ate this one. We ordered the Honey Chicken, Orange flavored beef and then the Subgum Fried Noodles. The egg rolls were nothing to write home about, but were crunchy, fresh and not too greasy.  My favorite was the Honey Chicken - it was crispy with just the right amount of sweet and with the white rice was a perfect combination. The quality of the chicken was high - delicious and seemed to be all white meat. The Orange beef was equally as flavorful, but the quality was ""meh"". A few pieces were a bit chewy (had a tough strand or two), but that does happen with beef. Didn't expect filet mignon at these prices!

The Subgum fried noodles were okay - none of us had tried this dish anywhere before so didn't know what to expect - it was a delicious assortment of meats and the quality of the meats were high. I just thought the sauce (a brown soy based sauce) was a bit bland, mostly just a salty taste, not much spice or flavor otherwise. The noodles were unique. If this dish had more flavor to it, I would order it again and again.

The best part was the ""surprise"" find of these delicious donut like rolls that were in our order for free. They were to DIE for, smack-your-dad-twice yummy. 

I thought for Chinese take-out, it's the best in the area and is definitely my #1 now. Other places around, the food seems to be bland or old and the food here by comparison is miles ahead. The prices absolutely can't be beat! Looking forward to trying some new dishes soon.",4,5,1

I have always been able to find a different and great selection of Polo Ralph Lauren clothing and other items here that weren't available at Macy's back home in Pittsburgh.

The staff are always helpful and I never have to wait long to pay and go. Several times during a sale I went to check out and the sales person had a coupon next to the cash register and used it for me so I could get extra savings off my purchase. Nothing like buying a $145 shirt for $17.99.

The men's shoe department is just as good. Very knowledgeable sales people that are not pushy at all and don't ask you every 5 minutes if you need help.

The men's fragrance counter on the other hand is very pushy and try to make you feel like you have to buy something. They are very similar to a used car sales person. I completely avoid the fragrance counter now altogether so I won't get hassled.

The server didn't seem like he knew what he was doing, yet we were the only table there.  The cocktails were horrible, and the server took forever to get our appetizer orders.  When we decided we wanted to add another appetizer, he was no where to be found.  This happened throughout the night where he was never accessible and was hiding who knows where.  I had the Farro with the wild mushroom, which was probably the best of all 6 dishes.  

The pizza was not as described as on the menu.  Being a vegetarian, I was completely appalled by the fact that they had meat on a pizza that was written as a vegetarian one.  The salad was small and way too salty.  

I'm used to and never mind paying a lot for food that is worth it.  My brother-in-law complained that his $26 fish was tasteless and completely dry.  My parents did not like their lamb at all.  

Upon finishing the meal, I was excited to hear they had creme brulee and baklava for dessert.  So we ordered one of each.  Both were terrible.   Our server asked if we cared for cappuccinos and we ordered 3.  Then he returned 5 minutes later and informed us they had shut down the espresso machine for the night.

Horrible dining experience with food and service overall.  We kept giving it another chance throughout the night but they were incapable of making up for it.  I never tip less than 20% but the more than  $30 in gratuity was a bit hard to swallow for the ""quality"" or lack of quality of service. 

We picked a horrible night to go out and ended up paying $20 of parking too.  Overall night was a bust.

Food came out looked great and tasted dangerously good ""not surprised"" since I've been there before but my client looked at me again and was like WOW!!! lol

If you want great food, atmosphere and entertainment this is the best place to throw any occasion. Perfect of buy outs, birthdays, bachelor\/bachelorettes parties and more. 

Heads up if it is your birthday or anything special the MC will pick on you lol. Your whole table will be challenged on who drinks the sake faster, then he'll put you on stage and start dancing and singing to you.

I mean, we're talkin the door's unlocked, but the ""open"" sign is turned off, the chairs are still sitting inverted on the tables, and neither the owner nor any waiters are there.

The first time, one of the cooks, who was busy in the kitchen, heard us come in and came out to greet us and offer us something to drink and eat. He didn't know how to make mixed drinks, but was happy to offer us some red sangria. The owner showed up 20 or so minutes later, apologized, and offered to make us something else (not comped or even discounted for the inconvenience, mind you). He seems pretty cool in general, though.

The second time, we walked in at 11:40am. By 11:55am someone just noticed we were there, and a waitress had just arrived. Both the cook and she were very nice and accommodating, but I'm still confused as to why they pretend to open at 11:30am when they clearly barely open at noon. I get it that that could be perfectly acceptable in the actual city of Barcelona, but come on, man.

All that aside, the food is good, but used to be better (they've recently changed several menu items for the worse, AND you get an expectations-versus-reality clash since the menu still has the old descriptions, but what shows up at your table isn't at all the same). Most of the menu items they have--including the sangria--Firefly on Paradise does better, hands down. But do I want to drive all the way there that often?

Unfortunately, while they open at 6 a.m., they don't actually start serving food until 11 a.m.  (why doesn't their website specify this important detail??). I was only passing through Cleveland and was in a rush so I couldn't wait around an extra two hours for them to open their kitchen.

However, I did have some baked goods such as a cookie and a crumble-bar thing (their only vegan options) and a cup of tea. The tea was overpriced but at least they have a decent selection of loose-leaf varieties. The baked goods were decent but didn't blow me away.

This place isn't particularly vegan-friendly or innovative. Most of the sandwiches are basic with different vegetables, and there's also a brown rice stir-fry and a variety of stone-oven pizzas (they don't have any vegan cheeses, however). All of the sandwiches are either $7 or $9 and the pizzas cost $9-13. It's a pretty pedestrian menu and slightly over-priced.

Given the dearth of vegan options in Cleveland, I suppose Root Cafe isn't a bad joint. But it's could certainly go further in providing interesting vegan items (how about some tempeh or tofu sandwiches\/tacos\/Italian pasta dishes? How about a lasagna made with TVP or seitan?

Our pho was tasty, but it was missing saw leaf (aka culantro) and a few of the Thai basil leaves were dark spotted. After our meals were served, the wait staff blatantly ignored us and we had to ask for the check. 

This may very well be our last time in Chinatown after a long absence from eating out in general. It used to be the cool place in Vegas to eat and shop at a good price. These days our experiences have been very negative. We've visited a few restaurants in this area and the same scenario plays out: non-American Asians and the few whites around are treated well; and everyone else F.U. 

What started out as a small enclave in the Westside where anyone could come as they were has now unofficially become ""Asian only"" in certain establishments. I guess the Asian tour buses in Chinatown Plaza take the place of other customers (local or not). This type of segregation reminds me of rural America and plays a big role in ruining the once vibrant spirit of Las Vegas. I was not raised to separate myself from others who are different than myself; and I find this new ambiance very jarring and disturbing. 

My advice is to observe the clientele and interactions to determine which places will be a right fit. It is not advisable to just ""walk in.""

the late night menu has bar food type apps and there's a few breakfast options, Chinese food menu and i believe fish and chips and a steak dinner option. but its pretty much the norm to come and get the late night steak and egg special for 6.99, the special consists of a thin but large steak, hash browns (think grocers freezer isle), large buttered toast slices, 2 eggs (your way) i sometimes omit the eggs for more hash browns.

My mother ordered the clam chowder because that's the main reason we came, she was craving it. It tasted very plain. By the looks of the restaurant (and price of the clam chowder) you'd think it'd be a little more hearty and flavorful. It wasn't. 

The thing that set me off was my truffle parmesan fries. I looked at the menu at least three times to make sure that ""weird dollop of garlic"" was supposed to be in the description. It wasn't. I wanted truffle parmesan fries, not soggy garlic fries. I could barely taste the truffle with all the garlic overpowering it.

I purchased an egg white omelet with spinach and sundried tomato's and sweet potato hash.  The sweet potatoes were very heavy on spices in a way that completely overwhelmed the omelet.  I took two bites but could not eat the rest.  

I purchased a chicken salad snack, but the chicken salad was a bit on the sweet side for me.  I was glad that I only purchased one of the chicken salad options they had available.

I purchased a snack with seasoned chicken, walnuts, apples, oranges, grapefruit and grapes, but the herbs on the chicken were a bit overdone.  It was ok as long as I ate a bite of fruit with each bite of chicken, but I would not buy this again.

The food was fresh and healthy.  Apparently the herbs and spices are used heavily so that you don't notice the lack of salt, but I found the amount of seasoning off-putting.  Nothing that I purchased had more than 270 calories.

The food was easy to prepare.  Instructions for heating were very accurate.  The smaller portion sizes were perfect for me.

The staff was very helpful.  They stay nearby and anticipate questions you may have as you browse the cases.  The cases were well organized into breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack sections.  Everything was color coded according to which meal they were, and large versus regular sizes.  Everything was also labeled with calories and relative to food sensitivities.

The food is not inexpensive, but is cheaper than eating out by a few dollars.  As a single person, it is also cheaper than purchasing raw ingredients that would likely go to waste.

1. Vegas Cirque shows are still better than this despite the $50M price tag.
2. The storyline well...is hodge-podge\/non-existent. So if you're looking for meaning to what you're seeing, you won't find any.
3. ONLY go if you get the tix at a discount (we got ours through LivingSocial).
4. The music is not the traditional abstract Cirque stuff - it was country rock that blares and is really annoying - not what I expected at all from the Elton John linked dude.

First impression of decor was just ok. Nothing special but nice and cosy. We were seated at our table and then tableware and wine glasses were set. They were busy and in their first week of operation so ill cut them some slack. 

Table was wobbly so I had to add some bar napkins at the bottom to stabilize. Ordered the house red wine and two pizzas from the menu.

Pizzas arrived relatively fast. We ordered both the margherita and spicy salami pizzas. Pizzas were relatively good but not really comparable to Libretto or Tennessee Williams in Ottawa. The wine came after the pizza arrived. 

Service was good considering they were busy and having some computer issues. They also don't take American Express which was slightly inconvenient.

They forgot to make the wonton first. 

The Bun Bo Hue was rather salty & the more you eat, the saltier it gets. Nothing outstanding about my dish, I thought it was a little below average. The vermicelli dish came with very little sauce, why? Because the sauce is very salty , I assume they think a little goes a long way. The pork was salty, but the shrimp was well-done & flavourful & by this time they haven't realized that they forgot my appetizer. Server boy was busy serving his own table sitting with the chef & bosses, took me a good minute to get their attention.

My group and I were quite disappointed with our experience here. We were in the mood for some dim sum, and since I heard this place was comparable to Orchids Garden, we decided to try this place out.

The restaurant wasn't even half full when we got our table, and yet this place still lacked service. The carts came by slowly and there was barely a selection of dim sum. We ordered a few items and the dim sum was cold. It must have been sitting out for awhile, and there wasn't any new dim sum coming out. Also, it took them FOREVER to bring us the water and tea. Since we weren't getting full off of dim sum, we decided to order some food off the menu (fried rice, noodles, and string beans), though it did take us a long time to order since nobody came by our table. When we got our noodles, they were very oily. The rice and string beans was mediocre, nothing to rave about. When we got our bill, we were surprised at the total. We weren't even full and yet we ended up paying a lot. Plus, they charge for tea. WTF! I have been eating dim sum all my life, and all of the places (Portland, Seattle, Vanc BC) I have been do not charge for tea. That is BS. 

Overall, I will NOT come back here again. What a horrible experience. The food lacked variety. The dim sum was cold. And the service was super slow. 

I tried Orchids Garden a few days before, and they were 10x better than this place. More dim sum selection, service was great, and reasonable price. When we left Orchids, we were stuffed and yet we paid less there than Pings.",3,2,2

The facility is VERY clean and brand new which is the first time I've ever been to such a clean dog care facility. I also really enjoyed the fact that they have staff members playing with the dogs throughout the day to make sure everyone is getting along and getting attention.

We (first) got lured into the Polaroid store by the giant (touristy, mind you)  Polaroid cut out that you could take photos in. The store is located in the Linq complex\/area... on the left if you're heading to the highroller from the strip. You will likely not be able to miss the giant picture cut out. 

When we went in we found another photo opportunity with the indoor Polaroid cut out (much better background). An employee had informed us of an actual photobooth that they have... which we gladly participated in. I'm sure there was an option to just have the photos emailed but we chose to have them printed... 6 for $6... on little cardboard Polaroids. Call me cheesy, but I love those little things! I also printed 6 photos from my phone for $6 :).

On our second visit (came back for more prints) we explored the museum located upstairs. It didn't cost us anything to get in and aestheticly it was amazing. I am by no means a museum expert or a photo snob... so maybe that's why it was particularly easy to amuse me... but I found the museum to be pretty fantastic and I loved looking at the photos (Andy Warhol focus, of course)... especially the huge color mural of photos!

But I was in Las Vegas for the weekend staying at Mandalay Bay, and there was a Border Grill at the Mandalay!  So me and my friends decided to give it a try.  I'm not a Vegas person at all since I don't like to gamble.  So I was just there for the pool, drinks and food!  
Susan Feniger of the Two Hot Tamales is the mastermind of Border Grill.  I've heard a lot of great things about it, so I was very excited to try it out!
We started out with the Cadillac margaritas and guacamole and chips.  I like my margaritas on the rocks no salt.  The waiter delivered mine with salt.  No biggie, I just wiped the salt away.
The guacamole was okay.  It was a bit on the creamy side for my taste.   I prefer guacamole on the chunky side.  One of my friends just loved the guac.
I decided to order one of the specials for the evening, which was highly recommended by our waiter.  It was tuna encrusted with pistachio served over a pobalno risotto topped with a jicama slaw.  My other two friends ordered the chile relleno and the pork slowly cooked in banana leaves.  
The tuna was way overcooked.  So overcooked that it was dry.  The waiter when explaining the special said it was cooked medium (slightly pink).  The risotto was also a big disappointment.  Some parts seemed like it wasn't cooked enough.  My dish was a big disappointment.  Also, my meal wish lukewarm at best.  It seemed like it was sitting out for a while.  I should've returned it after the first bite but I didn't since I had a second cadillac margarita to wash it down.
My friend's meals were way better than mine.  The chile relleno was very good.  But I thought the best meal was the pork slowly cooked in banana leaves.  It was cooked perfectly and great flavor.
For dessert we shared the empanadas stuffed with dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate.  And we also shared the homemade ice cream, a scoop of vanilla bean, and a scoop of kahlua chip.

Tip: The pizza is VERY thin.. more like flat bread, but it was still amazing. Our server said that one person can eat a whole pizza if it doesn't have meat on it. So plan accordingly. 

The ambiance of the place is very cool.

The ribeye was tasty, but not appreciably different from what I cook at home when I cook a prime cut. We tried the Broccolini, which was more stalks than tops. Mistake. The wine list is very pricey, and we had a bottle of Inglenook Cask Cabernet 2012. In stores, $60. Here, $180.

I really lost out, eh?!)

The service has always been a hit and miss type thing, but for the most part they are decent about it. They also add a 10% service charge to their bills, regardless of what time you eat or how many people are in the group.

The food itself is pretty good. They have a huge selection. Although it is an AYCE sushi place, they also offer an a la carte menu. There are vegetarian options (in case anyone is vegetarian in your party) and a wide selection of noodle\/soup, rice, dim sum, and teriyaki dishes (in case raw\/fish is not someone's thing).

As for the room itself-
Smelled funky overall with extremely strong smell of cleaning agent (not just in the room, but all over the hallway.  You walk out of the hotel smelling like Pinesol or something of that sort) 

The hotel is supposedly smoke-free, but on several occasion, I smelled pretty strong cigarette smoke coming into my room.  

The room was generally hot.  Good thing it was in the winter so I could just open the window and let the cold air in.  I think the AC in my room was broken.

It has a kitchen with a pretty good size refrigerator, stove, and microwave.  I wasn't planning to cook in the room, but might be convenient for people staying for long term.  

One other thing that really bothered me was that the shower makes this really high and creepy screeching shrieking noise the whole time it's on.  Really not a happy way to start or end your day.

I moved from about a block away from this place months ago and still hadn't tried it. We were looking for an easy takeout, non-fast food meal so finally decided to try them out.

The interior is actually a bit newer than the exterior may suggest. Nice and clean inside and a few tables for dine-in.

I ordered a veal sandwich with roasted peppers, jalapenos, and cheese; lasagna and a penne with meat sauce.

The veal sandwich was the highlight and something I'll certainly go back for. I can't think of anything negative about it. The meat was crispy and fresh, great roasted veggies and I liked having the option of jalapenos, which were also roasted.

The pasta was just okay, neither here nor there. Pretty good value for it, but from an Italian place (as I understand, it is Italian-run), I would hope for more authentic flavors especially with the sauce which was too sugary. I also saw some pizza by-the-slice, and it also struck me as very North Americanized. If that's you're thing however, give them a try and it's very inexpensive.

I'll certainly return for the sandwich and I saw that they also do churrasquierra chicken. The staff said they don't cook much at a time, in order to ensure freshness, so I hope that will be my experience. If so, it would provide another great takeout family option and save me a trip to the further (but ever so good) Nova Esperanca. 

A fairly positive experience and worth checking out.",0,0,1

My friends and I came in for lunch on a Saturday morning.  It was crowded, but we had a reservation and were seated right away.  Unfortunately, after we ordered, it took over an hour for our food to arrive.  When it did arrive, it was obvious that the food had been sitting out for quite some time, as it was completely cold.  Most egregiously, my friend's crepe had been sitting out for so long that the sauce had congealed.  We asked to see the manager.  When we explained the problem to him, he was completely unapologetic.  While we understood that the rest of our food might have looked fine to the staff, we showed him my friend's crepe, which was obviously congealed, and explained that it never should have been brought to us like that.  His response was to tell us that maybe we should work at the restaurant.  After this incredibly rude comment failed to convince us to drop the issue, he eventually took her crepe off the bill, and took 50% off the remainder of our entrees.  While this eventual response was appropriate, it would have been nice if his first instinct had been to apologize and try to make up for the restaurant's errors instead of to ridicule our concerns.  The sad thing is the food seemed like it probably would have been delicious if it had been brought to us hot.",3,2,2

I have never walked out of an Aladdin's without being completely stuffed as well as totally satisfied. I mean really, hats off to these guys because their food is not only awesome, its really consistent throughout their locations which I've noticed can sometimes be a problem with restaurants like this.

My typical order is either the hummus or baba for an appetizer, along with a side of vegetables. If you like hummus and hummus-like things but have never tried baba, get it. Seriously, you'll thank me later. Want to jazz it up a bit and get crazy? Ask for their special hot sauce. I don't know what exactly is in this stuff but it's like crack. I would bath in it if that wouldn't be super weird... Get it with the hummus too. One word: heaven.

Anyways, after I eat my weight in appetizers I get the vegan chili. It is honestly so good I have strongly considered ordering two servings of it for one sitting (no I totally do NOT have an eating problem! I swear!) 

Back when I wasn't vegan I would get the taza chicken salad. Guys, this dish is legit. Don't let the word ""salad"" scare you away, it is seriously so good and super filling. 

I don't think I have ever brought anyone here and had them not be totally impressed with the food and service. In fact, every time my sister comes into town she insists on Aladdin's. My family will even get a huge take-out order right before they leave to drive back to NY so they can have it when they get home. It's that good guys.

They also have a solid amount of Middle Eastern food stuffs and spices, so if you don't have an Uncle Samir to ship you za'atar, you might want to shop around the market a bit.

They'll cut any of their meats any way you want right in front of you and have prices that are not only affordably low, but surprising given the excellent quality of the meat. The only chicken I've had that's been cleaner and tastier than Salem's has been directly from the farm down the road from where I grew up. It's worth trying the pre-made marinades, too.

I've only eaten at the grill a few times, but was never let down in the quality or consistency of their menu. The cafeteria section is presentable (nothing to fawn over) and a fitting location to pop a squat with a buddy or two as you dig in to the feast in front of you.

Let my new tattoo heal up and show it off a little. Besides, it was just last night after work that I'd gotten my new ink. Alas, it appears my self-discipline is at an all time low, and less than 24 hours after walking out of L&H, here I am on Yelp. Sharing the love. Because, honestly, there's nothing I could think about hating on with this tattoo parlor. 

The time line that brought me to this point is rather lengthy. A little over a month ago, I rolled out of work early, caught a movie then decided I wanted to get my third tattoo. After finding some tats online, I decided I would follow through with it. A quick Yelp search directed me to L&H. When I showed what I wanted to have done and where on my body, the guy at the desk quickly grabbed one of the artist's portfolios, flipped through and showed me one of the exact same tattoos I saw online (but not cross referenced with L&H). Instantly, I knew this artist *had* to be the one to do this for me. However, with my work schedule and his availability, June 21 was the soonest I could make an appointment. 

In the month that followed, I started explaining to my friends what I envisioned and each of them appeared just as eager as myself to see the end results. 

Fast forward to last night, and Eric is referencing color copies of bacon and another tattoo from which I generated my initial concept, while using colored markers to sketch out how the basic tattoo will turn out. Honestly, at this point I would have been happy with just the marker tattoo (although I'm sure Eric would grow tired of me coming back every other day to have it redrawn). After a quick run through to outline where each color would be, Eric then moved on to the actual filling in. Throughout the two hour process, other artists who heard about this custom tattoo checked out the progress. By the time Eric completed his work, I sported one of the most unique and personalized tattoos I've ever seen. Even as it's wrapped in saran wrap to help the colors settle, I keep looking at it, admiring what will soon become my signature ink. 

Meanwhile, earlier this morning I sent out photos I took with my phone halfway through the process to a few of my coworkers. All are excited to see this, even the VP in Flagstaff (who I didn't intent to see this, but it's out of the bag now).",15,10,10

The sashimi appetizer was very good, it came with a jalapeno foam, dried kimchi, and dried bits of cauliflower and a bit of avocado ice cream that made for an interesting accompaniment.
Entrees were hanger steak and the prime rib.  The hanger steak came perfectly done and sliced on a squash puree (I wasn't looking forward to that, but was very pleasantly surprised at how it made a great sauce for the meat) and gnocchi, I didn't realize until later that I hadn't picked up the knife at all, everything was tender enough to cut with the fork.  The prime rib was a substantial cut that was also perfectly done, and came with their variation of yorkshire pudding that was hard to describe, but seemed more like fluffy, rich dumplings than the greasy mess that you often get elsewhere.  
Dessert was the ""Millionaire's shortbread"", a shortbread cookie covered in chocolate with some other items I've forgotten (it's been 2 weeks since I was there), but it was also quite tasty.  
The only complaint was that other than the prime rib the portions were on the smaller side, and the prices were a bit high, particularly for the starters and the dessert.  The menu was directly behind us so it was a bit awkward to read, and even then understanding just what it all meant took a while.
The waitress was very helpful and patiently answered all of our questions.
When I go back the hardest decision will be whether to go with one of the entrees we had or to try something new.

So the DJ only plays each song for about 3 seconds and the light up foamies were giving me severe motion sickness (It felt like I was in a moving tunnel!), and if we forget about the whole projectile vomit incident, the night was a ton of fun.

Out of this world. Enlightening. Splendid. I love when a chef can put together a combination that I've never heard of and makes it delicious. The pavlova has a nice crunch but is light like a cloud. The chai tea ice cream is strong on its own but mellows out and adds a nice spice when eaten with the pavlova. The raspberries add a sweet and tart note. Wow! Big enough to share, but... one hungry person could conquer this thing :)

She took me into a large private room after seating my MIL in the viewing area. She offered us both water which was great on a warm, muggy day. They had fans in each of the rooms as well as a chair and different sized kitten heels to try on with the gowns. They provide you with a Spanx shaper to help dresses look their best. Ali helped me with fitting every dress and gave me her honest opinion, which was refreshing. It was a great overall experience.

The shop is lovely and bright. They have a very good plus size dress section and I found 3 dresses that I adore. The prices were also very reasonable, one of the dresses I liked was $1,000 and it would be 4 times that elsewhere.

Most Ironman races are supposed to be, but theory & execution are two very different things.  The entire weekend went off pretty flawlessly & I felt welcomed and taken care of no matter where I went.

One thing I wasn't crazy about was the athlete dinner on Friday night.  The venue was nice to look at, but it was quite chilly outside & we couldn't sit through all of it.  The food wasn't so great, but it was still neat to be amongst all the other athetes.  Maybe next time we can have some outdoor heaters or something?  Just a thought.

Before the sun came up on race morning, we were being herded into the 60 degree water & up to the starting line.  Thank goodness for wetsuits!  After the pros took off, the directors & the Mayor of Tempe gave us some words of encouragement, pumped us up with some music, & fired the cannon.  Off we went into a mass of bodies and dark water.  I enjoyed the swim, save for the last 300 meters or so when someone decided to unzip my wetsuit.  Thanks, dude.  At least it was easy to get off once I climbed those stairs out of the lake!

Lucky us, the weather decided to be wonky this year, complete with crazy winds & some rain action.  Yay for us.  The only place this was extremely noticeable was on the bike, which was a 3-loop course meaning we hit headwinds every single time.  I swear, the last 8 miles took forever thansk to the 20-30 mph gusts.  Ugh!  The volunteers were great at handups & never lost their energy while cheering us on.  One tiny complaint: please put a 2nd (or 3rd or 4th) bathroom at the special needs stop.  Definitely a small holdup there due to lack of facilities.  I like cycling, but boy was I glad when the volunteers snagged my bike from me!  Nor did I miss it much as I headed out for the final leg of the race.

The run was also a 3-loop course, but that just meant I was better able to get my bearings.  It was fairly flat, though repeating one large hill 3 times got to be a little daunting.  All of the aid stations were well stocked & had enthusiastic volunteers.  You'd think the whole ""You're doing great!"" thing would get old, but as the sun goes down & it gets cold, you're thankful for any encouragement you can get.  Again agreeing with Yvonne R. - Chuck Norris never did an Ironman!  Thank you, hilarious spectators!

I don't think I can say enough about the fantastic spectators & volunteers.  Since the course was multi-looped, you could always count on someone being nearby to cheer you on.  The finish line was full of energy & lit up brightly for the entire city to see &, as soon as you're done, a volunteer is there to take care of you.  I also got to shake Chrissie Wellington's hand after I crossed the line.  How freakin' cool is that?!  Overall, it was an amazing race for my first Ironman & I had a blast.",5,1,7

Well they didn't disappoint as the food was great! The presentation on the shrimp cocktails was unique and appetizing.  Rather than hanging them from the lip of a glass, which is what everyone else does, they had individual elongated concave ice cubes for each piece of shrimp and a small glass dish for the cocktail sauce.  Very nice.
The skirt stake was sliced, perfectly cooked to the requested temperature on a nice bed of fresh mashed potatoes and drizzled with some nice gravy.  There were a few strands of watercress which provided a nice bouquet.

I mean, they clean your room twice a day! I wasn't expecting them the second time, so I left a mess with all my makeup\/hair stuff in the bathroom. I come back in after they cleaned the second time and they organized all my stuff on the bathroom counter! (and it was all still there, yay!). I mean service is just over the top.


Went with the boyfriend for three nights. Upgraded to a suite for an extra $150\/night and it was worth it. I got a view of the strip and wasn't disappointed. The room was immaculate, love the styling, everything was so clean and polished, superb. The ONLY down side was that our room had a bathroom with only fogged out glass. So if you are staying with someone you aren't extremely comfortable with, that might be a little awkward. I mean I'm comfortable w\/ my bf, but it's strange they didn't include soundproofing\/ventilation in a closed-off bathroom.

The service people from the front desk to the guy who holds the door open for you at the pool were outstanding, professional, and over-the-top friendly. Boyfriend and I got room service. I loved their homemade yogurt and fruit, he got some huge breakfast that he seemed to really enjoy too. I believe it to almost be worth the extra cost of room service! 
 
Spent one day at the pool, service was excellent and they make a good drink ;) The pool area was fairly small, but there were enough seats for everyone when we were there (weekend\/100+ degrees). 

It doesn't have a casino and is very quiet. If you go to Vegas looking for a cheap room and a crazy party, this isn't the hotel for you.

My wife and I visited here after being excited to eat at a gordon ramsay restaurant (we are fully aware he has probably never even been in the restaurant) 

Food was all great, cocktails were great too. I can get great food and great cocktails at about 100 different places just off the top of my head. All 100 of them also provide service.

Greeting took 10-15, i  wasnt checking my watch because I was trying  to avoid my wife becoming aware of the lengthy wait, not because she is a bitch, because i didnt want her experience going south upon arrival.

cocktails took about 5 minutes.  not terrible, not quick (it was a monday night and not very busy)

Long story short, the service was sluggish at best, the server was friendly and generally acknowledged that things were moving slowly and she apologized. water under the bridge for us. the food made up for it..

Then the manager happened. Not the younger guy who had stopped by our table once to say hello and ensure we were happy. Not him at all, this manager was the old guy, the one wandering around the restaurant not talking  to anyone. the one who spent all his time chatting up the hostesses until....

He turned all of the music off and all of the tv's off 15 minutes till 11. at first I thought this was odd (i thought they closed at 1030) i then remembered that they closed at 11. 
wtf? why dont you just tap us on the shoulder and demand we pay before getting the fuck out?
the most ironic part is that we would have been gone already if our server wasnt once again totally absent for 15 minutes.

Now that we live here with the deal we decided to try it out for Sunday brunch. This was nothing short of a disaster. There was no line at 11:30am. Our server mumbled under her breath about no one telling her she had customers. She was very loud and abrasive. Their beer and wine choices are the basic bottom shelf. They have many stations, however there are only a few items at each one, except the dessert station. The dishwasher was not working well that day, the first plate I picked up had pancakes and gravy from the plate below (full portions), not an appetizing way to start. The salad section just had so few selections, it was not manned. The Indian station was not manned either, 3 vegetarian entrees and tandoori chicken chunks. Asian was a bit better, not manned. The meat carving station....both beef hunks were cooked to death, no life...ugh! There was an attendant. The Italian and Mexican were both weak with no imagination, just blah selections. Desserts - this was very disappointing. It was mostly bready type things. Many of the prettier desserts were a base of dense pound\/sponge cake and then decorated differently. These were not fresh, however there was an attendant who was refreshing items and was able to answer a question. They did have cheesecake, crème brulee and flan which were ok. They did have smoothies on one of the salad bars. Just really really disappointing food. Back to our server. She or no one else cleared our plates during our entire meal, so they stacked up. I met her when I was in line for dessert and asked her for another silverware service and napkin. She complained that she had to go in several directions to get these, but she would TRY....WHAT?? They are all bundled together. My husband just went to the hostess station to get it. We heard her announce that she was off the floor and still had not visited to ask us anything or clear plates, but she was attending other tables in our section. Another server came by to clear plates. After our server left (for a break??) and came back with a different shirt on, she delivered the silverware and napkin I had asked for 20 minutes prior and made some excuse that it was just such an effort to get it. She then noticed that my wine glass was still full and spent 5 minutes trying to convince me to get something else, when I clearly stated no, I was fine. We thought oh no, this is part of the Ceasars total buffet package now and maybe these casinos are just not interested in keeping standards because they have turned them into lower quality troughs....buffets have their reputation, but not so long ago they used to do a really nice job, especially for brunch.

Amazing selection of beers and reasonable prices compared to the rest of the strip restaurants- is what saves this place.

We had the fried pickles and the gyoza. Random... but we weren't about to pay 20 dollars for a burger- at least not here. Both appys were solid. Nothing amazing- but good fresh ingredients, and hearty portions for sharing.

The service was decent, but not up to par with 20 dollar burger prices.

vThLXg8uwTQ0_WI5squhNw,7H6dKm52fnJGdNGsmXkt2A,JKM8N-qeXl_cLXOFRpevEA,2,2014-04-15,"I'm reluctantly giving Wine Bar Rocky River a humdrum review, and it's not totally the restaurant's fault. I had this miserable job once, and the boss insisted on having lunch meetings there on a fairly regular basis. I appreciated the opportunity to sit on Wine Bar's lovely patio and sip wine while working, but lunch was always a disappointing experience and I never did figure out why Boss wanted to go there all the time. He had this weird thing about supporting local restaurants, even if he didn't really like them. That sort of nonsense is only mildly symptomatic of what my work experience was like ... but this is supposed to be a restaurant review.

Wine Bar's food is hit or miss. I really love the risotto ball appetizer, because their marinara sauce is deeply flavored and tastes like it's been simmering all day. I had some sandwiches and salads that were pretty good. I also had one memorable Caesar salad -- memorable in a bad way. They place whole anchovies atop their Caesar salads. I can stomach anchovy flavor in Caesar dressing if it's used with a light hand ... but this salad absolutely reeked, and worse yet, despite my attempts to eat around the fish, I couldn't get the taste of anchovy out of my mouth for days. Boss often ordered sandwiches or burgers, and sometimes entrees. He almost always had a complaint about something and left his food untouched. He was a fan of their ""wino fries,"" but I didn't think they were anything special. 

The wine list is extensive, but kind of pricey. It was tough to order wine that met with Boss' approval, so I usually deferred to him. The average glass price seemed to be about $8.

Service can be pretty neglectful and unfriendly. It was difficult to get water refills on almost every visit. Servers often couldn't answer basic questions about the menu. We even had inattentive service from the manager, who openly badmouthed the owner, chef and other employees when he did come around. Boss had this odd habit of asking for things to be prepared for him off-menu ... which he was often told they do not do ... in such a perfunctory manner, I wondered if he gave the staff a hard time when he came here on his personal time with his family. They certainly did not cater to him as a ""regular,"" as he seemed to think they should. Which was kind of amusing ...

The restaurant itself is kind of small inside and can be very noisy (which was always a challenge for us because Boss had a hearing issue)  because of the acoustics and TVs mounted on the walls. The patio, however, is lovely, with string lights, shady spots and heaters if needed. Wine Bar is located in a small nook off of Detroit Road and shares parking with a few other shops and another restaurant. Get here early if you want a space, because parking is in short supply.

Don't think I'll really return here now that I have moved on to a better employment situation. Boss is probably still sitting there, ordering things to be made special for him that Wine Bar doesn't offer, and complaining about every little thing. No offense, Wine Bar. Too many bad memories. I agree with some other Yelpers that I want to like it, but just can't. I'd go back despite my negative association if I did, but there are other places in the area that I prefer.",2,1,1

I was looking forward to staying at this hotel on a recent business trip with my wife.  I have always admired the outside structure and its natural ambiance that accompanied it.

Needless to say I was very let down.

This hotel is getting one star for the following reasons:
1.  The inside of the hotel felt very claustrophobic, low ceilings and narrow walking spaces were very confining.
2.  for the 5 days I was there the same room service tray was left in the hallway next to our room.  It started developing an odor which my wife and I called about, but they did nothing until the last day when they offered to give us credits\/new room upgrade.  So perturbed that we declined any of their concessions and asked just that the please just pick up the ""damn"" tray and we will be fine.
3.  The rooms were uncomfortable, tired looking, and very similar to a cheap room you would find at a motel 6.
4.  The location though great on the strip is not as conveniently located next to the Las Vegas Monorail as described.  You have to walk through the hotel, through the corridor that connects it to Bally's then through Ballys... its casino... restaurants....sports book... over the hill and through the woods and your there.  Though proximity is not their fault, advertising is.
5.  Staff was extremely rude, from front desk to room service attendants.

These issues are the factors for my scoring, though I could probably live with giving them a 2 star rating, my personal frustration of my experience and the overly high overall score (my opinion only) took it down another peg.",3,0,0

My brother especially loves it on Tuesdays where the burgers are half price! 

This neighbourhood pub is only about 2 blocks from where I live so I am a bit biased. The service is very friendly and the menu is your standard pub fare. We all got burgers (of course) but also started off with a big plate of nachos with all the fixins (chicken, steak and chili plus all the usual cheese, jalapeños, sour cream, salsa, etc). 

With the burgers, we all decided to try different sides (fries, sweet potato fries and a Greek salad). 

Everything was delicious but I'd give the burgers only about a 3 out of 5. Try them out on a Tuesday where you only pay half the price and see what you think. My brother loves them so maybe I am just picky but as I have stated in previous burger reviews, I prefer a burger made with ground chuck and this seemed more like a good quality grocery store frozen variety. I think the best comparison of this burger would be a Harvey's burger (which a lot of people enjoy, so I don't want to knock Harvey's).

But anyways, you get there, and there are a bunch of rocking chairs for you to sit on and play a game of giant checkers, and you can even buy a rocking chair if you'd like.

You get in and, like other reviews, it really is like a gift shop, and then you walk into the back which is a HUGE and clean restaurant that has a great atmosphere and seats plenty. We immediately got our table for two and I ordered the Country Fried Steak Breakfast platter that also came with 2 eggs cooked by my choice, 2 biscuits with gravy, grit (which was sort of plain, but I threw some gravy in to try to make it better, it was my first time trying grit), and hash brown casserole. ALL THAT FOR $7.99!? What the hell, I've never seen a price that great for that much food. My brother got something similar and then ordered a side of sausage patties, which went perfect with my biscuits. I got my order and the first thing I did was make a sausage mcmuffin, the country fried steak was good and so was the casserole, though it coulda been hotter and crispier, but it was still great.

We started hearing people walking in the hall (we were thinking people were up late coming inside the hotel)  We also heard children laughing in the hallway, and heard someone sneeze in the room next to us.  We figured the walls were very thin, so we tried to sleep, and finally we did fall asleep. I really did not get a good night's sleep.  The next day when we were checking out, we talked to someone who told us  there were no children out that late in the halls, and there was no smoking permitted at the hotel.  We also wondered about people coming in late, so we figured out, where could people be coming in from so late at night except from Vegas?

It's difficult to find soft serve version. I'm a huge fan of this black sesame icecream with waffle cone!!!~ It has a good strong black sesame flavour (not sweet like the supermarket boxed version of ice cream). 
Usually after dinner time, we often find a line up in this small joint. It has enough seats in there to fit 2 tables of 4, another table for 2, and row of single seats along the wall. Not a great place to sit and eat ice cream if this place is full. 

I also tried their matcha --- NOT A FAN. it is far too bitter for my liking. It left a bad after taste instead of just green tea flavour. 

However, once you mix the blacksesame + matcha swirl together, this combo is GREAT! You can't feel the intensity of the green tea bitterness and if some people doesn't like the sweetness of the black sesame, this twist seems to bring it down a little. GREAt GREAT COMBO!!! Again, love the waffle

Did you see the amount of time I stood behind the counter before someone helped me at the different times?  Did you see your staff member eat a piece of patron's food while working behind the counter? Did you see that my order was not even placed on the line? Did you see the lady lie to me when I arrived and said it was only going to be another 5 to 10 minutes, then scamper to the back to even find the order? Did you see the three guys behind your counter just clowning instead of cooking?  The only thing I saw them cook during the time I was there was two orders of garlic knots - maybe that's why you were so far behind?  Did you see your hostess was hanging outside petting her dog when I arrived at a place of business with a sign that says wait to be seated?

Als Vorspeisen wählten wir Oktopussalat und geräuchertes Makrelenfilet vom Grill mit Essig- Öl Marinade. Die Gerichte kamen schnell, waren frisch zubereitet und  geschmacklich Hervorragend! Die Messlatte lag hoch und sollte mit den Hauptgängen noch übertroffen werden.
Dorade vom Grill und Gyros  waren unsere Wahl. Wie uns der junge Inhaber in einem netten Gespräch mitteilte, wird das Gyros (sehr gut gewürzt) wird jeden Tag frisch gesteckt und die frittierten Kartoffeln selbst gemacht. Die Dorade war einfach Exzellent und wurde, auf Wunsch, filetiert gereicht. Alle Gerichte, bis dahin, eine Geschmacksexplosion sondergleichen.

So when my boyfriend told me that him and some friends had gone to a sandwich place called Capriotti's out here for lunch I said to myself, ""Could it be?"". It is!! It is!!! The very same one!! Bobbies and all!!! Oh happy day!!!! Randomly they have a couple of west coast locations, one of which happens to be 2 miles from my house, and for having the foresight to put that there, I thank them! In college, my roommate and I always vowed that one day, we would pool our money and split a Bobby. Tragically, it was always out of our 52 cent Ramen Noodle price range, so that dream never came true, until now. Although my lovely roomie of 3 1\/2 years is not here to share it with me, I got to have that Bobby, and OH was it worth waiting for. Fresh, delicious rolls, real roasted turkey, not that sliced stuff my friends, just like mama makes, and stuffing and cranberry to top it all off. I'm a happy girl! If I didn't have Thanksgiving plans, I'd probably just get myself a Bobby and call it a day. The people are always friendly and the sandwiches are a little more than $5 for a foot-long, but OHHH SOOO worth it!! After reading all these reviews about the cheese steak, I'm excited to try that now, but it will take a lot of willpower to NOT order the Bobby.",0,0,0

Great food, large portions, relatively reasonable prices. Blackened fish with the topping of the day is always a good choice! I also love the Diane with all 3 ($20.95) - Chicken, Shrimp, & Crawfish plus Mushrooms, Garlic, Butter, Green Onions, Parsley and Spices sautéed together and served over rice. This dish is huge so you won't leave hungry. Ask them to spice it up a bit if you like spicy food. The dishes are a little mild for my taste. Try, if you can, to save room for dessert. The warm bread pudding & the pecan pie are delicious. 

Cons: 
- awful parking. At least they have valet now, but who wants to wait on their car after stuffing themselves with Cajun food?
- seating is packed in way too close together. If you want an intimate date spot, this is not the place.
- drinks are tasty, but a bit watered down for the price. Not the place in Charlotte to go just for a drink or two.

I was not expecting actual singing, lol, but everybody enjoyed the entertainment.  It's a fairly small restaurant which, along with the intimate lighting, gave it a cozy feel.  Overall, a nice-looking place.  But the strong whiff of deliciousness coming from the kitchen is what reeled me in.  Also, the servers are very courteous and attentive, not a single staff member was without a smile.

We had quite a variety on the table.  I ordered the green curry chicken with steamed rice.  My dad ordered moo goo gai pan (which isn't on the menu, but the chef was able to prepare it).  My mom ordered chicken egg foo young and mu shu pork to share, and my grandma had orange chicken with the sauce on the side to keep it crispy.

We sampled each other's dishes, which were all tasty.  When I got to my green curry I was floored.  The flavor  of the coconut milk-based sauce was smooth, herbaceous and mildly spicy.  Bathing in the sauce was tender chicken, crisp bamboo shoots, just-cooked green beans, green bell peppers, eggplant and a touch of Thai basil.  Spooned on top of fragrant jasmine rice, the dish was an instant favorite at the table.  I even tried it on the fried rice - so good.

The servers ensured that our food arrived promptly to the table, hot and fresh.  They were on top of it all night.  Even the owner, Sherry, visited our table to see if we were enjoying our meal before and after ascending to the stage for a performance.

Although it was a busy Saturday night, the great food and excellent service made my family and I feel like we had the restaurant all to ourselves.  I can't wait to come back and try more of Singing Pandas' dishes.  I've got my eye on the pan-fried noodles next!",0,0,1

At least they have full hook-ups in case you need to cool down. Oh, and there's the ever diminishing Lake Mead for all your recreation needs.

We stayed two nights (Sep. 11-12, 2017). Our total charges minus a $9 Good Sam discount was $91.53.

PROS
- friendly staff
- dogs allowed
- full hook-ups including cable
- paved roads and level concrete parking pad
- restrooms and showers nearby
- laundry facility
- trash and recycling bins
- fire ring w\/ grill
- marina close by
- free Wi-Fi
- many attractions nearby such as Hoover Dam, Hemenway Valley Park, etc.
- plenty of day hikes in the area

CONS
- very warm to hot climate year-round
- restrooms were dirty

TIPS
- Just like Jean M. mentioned in their review, we paid for a ""Lake View"" site which provided a spectacular panoramic view of Lake Mead and a lightning storm very far in the distance one mid-September evening. I suggest you pay a little extra for the lake view site too.
- Good Sam discounts offered

It has been probably 10 years since my last visit and I remember thinking it was just ok, nothing great. And, after returning this year, I can clearly say I am not missing out on anything. Cabo Fish Taco is just okay...just don't get what all the hype is about.
We arrived shortly after 7 on a Monday night and did not have a wait, which was great. We were seated in the new addition of the restaurant (which may not be so new, but since the last time I was there). It is definitely a great addition to the location, very open with a full bar and multiple tables.
Monday nights they offer a Margaritaville Margarita for $5.00 so we started with those and were brought chips and salsa, which is corn and tomatoes.  This is the one thing I remember people love about Cabo, not me. It is okay, but no flavor. Needs a little salt. And the chips, they are chips. Not hot, don't seem fresh and need salt.

I ordered the Chicken Quesadillas with a side a refried beans. The quesadillas were good, grilled perfectly with melted cheese, chicken and peppers and onions. The peppers and onions definitely could have been cooked more. As for the beans, blah. Wouldn't bother with those again. My friend ordered the Tavarua Tacos and was not impressed. He also ordered the jalepeno mashed potatoes which sounded really good but said they were nothing great.

The wheel of sin is just that, a big spin-able wheel with different happy hour specials: $5 Jose Shots, $7 patron shots, $5 margaritas, Etc.

I have been to a handful of hairdressers in my 24 years of life -some great experiences and others dreadful. About 2 weeks ago I went to Snip Snip after seeing rave reviews on Yelp, Google, and Facebook - 5 stars on all social media sites. My hair was in desperate need of help. It had been bleached, colored, blacked out, and dried out. It was down to my butt and although I loved the length it was ultimately dead and unhealthy. I had to find help in reviving what I had left. My hair needing saving - more than what a simple haircut salon could do. On top of it all my husband was tired of me literally hiding my hair in a hat everyday - and I mean EVERYDAY. From the moment I first spoke with James and made the appointment I knew he was genuine and really wanted to help me. When I arrived at his salon he was excited, curious, creative, and helpful. He knew what would be best for me and my hair. During the appointment we talked about one of the most creative geniuses and musical masterminds of our time - Björk - and even got to watch one of her films as well. We decided on a Brazilian Blowout and to chop off about half my hair in order to make it look healthy and have movement. In the end of it all it was well worth it! My hair has not looked so good in so long. I have movement, texture, volume, and hair that feels like HAIR and not hay. I can not believe the talent that James has in the profession of hair. He gets a 5 star rating - a perfect 10\/10 - and a 100% critic score. Not only is his hair talent amazing but his personality is beautiful. He loves what he does and you feel that in the chair. He is someone who celebrates life and wants you to do it as well. He saved my hair but also made me feel beautiful. He is an artist with a gift. If you want your locks to look their best while also making an awesome friend then go to Snip Snip and see James. You won't be disappointed and you will definitely want to go back! 

To James - thank you so much for everything! You are a savior!",0,0,1

Within a few moments there were several of us waiting outside the office for the same appt. time.  No chairs or place to sit.  After a 45 minute wait the office opened at 7:45 then it took another 15 minutes for several of us to sign in.  I was given a clip board and was asked to complete the information needed for my appt. I was told all my records from my previous doctor would be on file upon my arrival.  It took approx. 30 minutes to complete the forms while at least 15 more people piled into a small space provided for patients.  I continued to wait another hour while people who arrived two hours after me were seen by the doctor.  I approached the receptionist and asked if I was put at the end of the patient list.  I arrived at my appt. 45 minutes early to complete any paper work required and was treated like I was late for my appt.  The staff and doctor were very rude and brief.  I attempted to discuss my issues with my new provider (I have diabetes) and was totally ignored. I asked if my records had been transferred and was told only if the doctor feels it is necessary.  I had a brief eye exam by the nurse and before I realized it both the nurse and doctor left the room.  I found my way to the waiting room and left the office.  

Due to a persisting problem with my right eye I had to make an appt. with CFS.  I have put this appt. off for many months since I am so uncertain of the care and diagnosis I will be receiving.  Senior Dimensions has chosen CFS for their primary eye care providers and I have no choice but to use their provider at this time.

Each location has a slightly different menu so when I was in Phoenix for a business trip I wanted to make sure to get the chef's specials for this location. I had the lobster sushi roll and lobster pot stickers for appetizers, and the Himalayan Sea Salt Ribeye with a side of scallops for the entree. Although I love Roy's I have to say the steak wasn't that great. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly, but the cut of meat had too much connective tissue I had to work around.

Boy, do I hate it when they add that $30 ""resort fee"" on top of listed prices.  How is that legal?  It's not just this hotel; many of them do that.

The valet service was fast and efficient, as was check-in process.  Folks were super friendly, so they definitely do that right.  Because of the price, we got a room without any view.  You get what you pay for, so that's okay.  You don't really go there to look out of the room window anyway.  

I did have to work a bit while I was there, so the free wi-fi is a huge plus. I was pleasantly surprised by the speed of the connection.  I learned that you really have to work in the room if you want peace and quiet.  There is NO WHERE else in the hotel where it's quiet enough for a phone call.  Even their business centers are open air, so people yelling, slot machines just fill the air.  Even the hallways have blaring overhead music.  I even tried the garage at one point and realized there was loud music there too.  

As for the rest of the hotel, it really is showing its age. Everything is kind of dark. The decorations could use some refreshing.  The tables have a minimum of $10 in the morning, so that's good if you're not a heavy gambler.

Check-out was easy as they offer different ways of doing it.  You can even text message or email your check-out.  I was impressed by this.

UPDATE: Thank you for your response, Lori. I'm not sure I agree that it's a ""communications shortfall.""  This is done intentionally to place higher in the aggregator searches. Most hotels on the strip do it and I find it deceptive. I wish everyone would just call it what it is.",8,2,2

We first ordered the samoons (excuse spelling errors) and they came to us with a warm outside and cold inside, a sure indication of them not being fresh and most likely frozen beforehand. Then we ordered the combination platter with each a side salad. The salad was measly at best. Very little lettuce and only a tomato on top. The food came out and was also partially cold.

Also, this is so far from authentic. They gave you silverware. Also, platters should be served on a large tray, almost like a pizza tray, with injera covering the whole thing. The chosen dishes then on top. NOT in a bowl. 

I've had Ethiopian food in both NYC and SF, both times phenomenal and authentic. I would never ever bring someone here for their first Ethiopian food. They would get the wrong impression.

My family of eight individually ordered six different kabob dishes, and the server took it upon himself to present the meals in a ""family style"" setting. All the kabobs were on one plate, and the rice came in two platters.

It's hard to track if you're getting the right amount of kabobs, and someone who ordered sultani may be getting screwed out of his ratio of barg to koobideh, or maybe a chicken eater doesn't want the juice of red meat on her chicken barg. You get the idea.

If you want to serve it family style, please ask first.

You buy a lounge chair ($15 at the time) and it's only for the chair... which is why it is so cheap.

Well he really works magic, you tell him a number you want to pay that man will try his best to make sure you're in a car you like..

10 out of 10.  The car has just had it's 15,000 mile tune up my boyfriend takes care of his cars. The car is easy to flip on the lot, it works out better for everyone. HE gets a brand new car, the one he wanted originally one year ago his credit want good enough. But with his early or on time payments his credit has gone up a lot.  Now someone looking for a FAST certified preowned vehicle will be a stepping stone for someone else like it was for us. Stay up if not early on your payments.

First, the $3 wash is just a water spray with the spinning brushes.  For $5 they'll actually spray on soap of some sort (I forget how they described it...special whiz-bang soap...you know what I mean?).  We did the $5.

The car went through their machine and came out clean.  It does use the spinning brushes, so obviously is not ""brushless"" or ""touchless"".

The hubby & I got a seat right a way when we arrived but the host seated us in a table that was not prepped with silverware let alone cleaned off. There was a perfectly ready table right across that he could have seated us in instead but what ever. Half a star off. 

Our food took over 1\/2 an hour for the fist dish to come out. That's defiantly one star off. What we ordered:
- For starters: DW chicken lollipops $12 This was served under cooked. But we didn't complain cause by the time we were served the hubby & I were famished. For what ever reason I was thinking this dish would be crumbled-up chicken rolled up in bread crumbs and served on a skewer. Instead it's drumstick chicken with the the ends cut off to make the lollipop look. I wasn't impressed only because the bone exposed where shared and there was bits of shared bone on the meat. Over priced for my taste. 
Another 15 minutes later we get our main dishes.
- The hubby ordered: DW bowl of New-Mexican-style slow cooked pork $11. This dish came with a lot of kick and was delicious, I speak for my husband too, lol. Definitely worth the price
- I ordered: Jerk fried chicken & waffles $14 Now when I was ordered this I was thinking of Roscoe's chicken & waffles just w\/a Jerk flava. I sure wasn't reading the description when I ordered this, lol. As stated the chicken was served on top of the waffles. I'm not a cook per se but I don't think that's a good idea. Well the description goes on to say atop crispy waffles but if not served right a way it withers down and takes the crisp a way, which it did. But I must say their signature syrup was delicious. The chicken though was slightly over breaded but came with a good amount Jerk flava. 

The atmosphere is really nice, I agree with the other comments it does look like the inside of Ikea. Aside from the Jamaican hot sauce bottles and the color splash in the restroom it could use a dash more Caribbean feel to make it complete. The restaurant fairly sized with outdoor seating but deng it got pretty loud inside, lol. 

The house manager was nice enough to make his rounds and check on guest but of course misses our table so another half star off. I know it's sound a little petty but it makes me feel because I'm brown, lmfao. 

So overall 3 stars for now. I say that because we're definitely coming back to try out their dinner menu and who know's we might get to meet the owners next time.",0,0,0

The food as has been well documented is fantastic if you make the right choices.  The blue cornmeal muffins that come out with the bread are excellent.  I started with the tiger prawn tamale.  The tamale itself was done perfectly and not over spiced, instead letting the subtle maza mix with the sweet and smoky corn veloute served under it.  The prawns themselves were succulent and extremely fresh.

My main course was the grouper.  It was very good, but nothing too original or mind blowing.  The highlight of my meal was actually the side of corn I wittingly ordered.  I usually have a knack for picking the best item on a menu (or at least the one that sounds like they really know what they're doing on that also fancies my taste buds) and this corn was another prime example of that.  The roasted corn is done in a cream stock with nopal (cactus), with hints of lime and topped with cotija cheese.  The result is a perfect balance of a rich blend of sweet, sour, and salty.

My boyfriend and I turned it into a spur-of-the-moment date night, which are my favorite kind of date nights. At first glance, I was nervous that we were a bit underdressed in just t-shirts and jeans... (Y'know how some famous Italian joints can be)... The building had a string-lit courtyard and I could hear a live band covering ol' Blue Eyes from the parking lot, but to my surprise, this place is the classiest casual spot I've ever been to. I mean, it seemed to be the neighborhood's after-work spot, which makes me like it even more. Nobody cares which fork you use first!

The menu was incredible! Pricy, but there's so much to choose from. The boy and I decided to go out on a limb and try something new as an appetizer: Braised Pork Neck Bones. Tbh, it kinda weirded me out at first but the pork was so delicious and fell right off the bone, all while soaking in a flavorful broth that begs to be sopped up by toasted garlic bread. We also ordered classic bolognese and manicotti as our entrees, which were so yummy and came with the biggest portions - Perfect to take home and nuke for lunch the next day.

You get an entire half a chicken fried with old school pasta salad, a vinegary coleslaw and a stack of fresh tortilla straight from Reyna's Foods down the block.
We started off with the Yucatan Bean Dip appetizer. If you've ever had the bean dip at Mad Mex you'll recognize it. It's beany, slightly salty and a little spicy. Very flavorful.

I have to say, the chicken is a little steep at 15 dollars a plate but I thought it was amazing. The chicken was delicious and browned nicely and the ranch-style dip they give you is a really good with accompaniment. I love being able to pick apart the chicken and put it in the tortilla and make myself a little taco. I'm a huge fan of Mexican food so blending southern cuisine with the containment system of a Mexican tortilla is great.
I hate coleslaw, especially mayo-based. If it is a vinegar based slaw I tend to like it a wee bit more. The coleslaw I had at Kaya was so good I ate all of it. It had little bits of pepper in it, a huge vinegary kick and a spiciness that I think came from ginger.

The pasta salad was like what your grandma would make. The chef at Kaya really must like the sourness of vinegar, however, because it's really evident in this dish as well. Luckily, I love that in food. I could see a lot of people being overwhelmed by it.

The only complaint was when my girlfriend ordered a Mojito. When it came I took a sip and thought it was pretty bad. It mostly tasted like alcohol and the ripped mint floating inside overwhelmed it to the point where you couldn't taste the mint anymore so much as the leafy flavor underneath. I did not care for it at all.

I definitely want to check out what Kaya has on their actual menu. I'll be back.",1,0,0

We were walking along the Strip, still in that dazed adjustment period when you've just stepped outside in Vegas, and a man approached us waving a handful of coupons. I usually avoid all manner of strange evangelist on the street, but we were in the right mood, and this guy was saying something about two-for-one beers and cocktails.

We followed him down a long, weird alley, an arcade of random little stores, many of them closed on a Sunday afternoon. Just when I thought it wouldn't be that surprising if he killed us, Fuel Bar appeared, occupying the far corner space of this odd arcade.

It was a small bar, tiny, really, but with open walls, so its clientele could spill out into the corridor. I never felt like we'd actually entered the bar. There was a decent crowd going, maybe there for the coupon happy hour, or for whatever sports were on the television. Two bartenders handed out drinks in a quick and upbeat fashion--they were also performers of sorts, tossing bottles as they mixed up their cocktails.

We just wanted some walking-around drinks, so we got two Coronas with lime to go.

Perhaps it sucks if you are the type to get emotionally attached to your hair stylist, and share juicy infomation about your lives, but if you don't care about that, then this place is for you!

My hair has ALWAYS looked amazing, because they actually care about what they are doing- and not because they have to because they are in school- but because they are new to the profession and aren't burnt out\/cigarette smoking\/over processed middle aged women.  The atmosphere is fun and hip, and their products are displayed nicely.  They also don't try to cram their products down your throat, which always makes me want to buy them!

So pricing? CANNOT be beat.  I pay $43 for a cut and partial highlights.  I leave a $10 tip (cash only, they won't let you leave more than that) and I save because I have a student ID.  $53 for the whole deal.  I have no clue where I'd get this great job done outside of here....not even Super Cuts could do better.  It may take them a bit longer (I was there 3.5 hours today) but who doesn't love having someone play with your hair for 3.5 hours?!  What a bargain!

For some, the thought of going to a school is probably scary, but the students are very astute, they care about what they are doing and are excited about being hands-on.  The instructors have to come check in at certain stages of the process, so mistakes are very very rare- I suppose if there was a big mistake, the instructors would fix it. The students are also very good at giving each other positive feedback (no whining, complaining, groaning about coworkers here!)  They also give a free hand massage and massage the heck out of your head and hair when shampooing.",5,0,0

Hubby's greatest complaint is that the cheese in his omelette was cheese slices not real cheddar, but the potatoes made up for this flaw.

I love combos where you can get bacon and eggs AND pancakes, you can't get that at Cora's and I won't even acknowledge Golden Griddle as food!

It's a charming little spot that food snobs might not appreciate but if you are like me and don't ever make a full breakfast at home because of the number of pans required to cook bacon, eggs, home fries, pancakes, etc. Chew chews is your chance for an old school breakfast at a reasonable price!

After the meat fell to the plate he told me to use the little fork next time....Mm-k-thanks. A lot of the meats were actually very dry and tasteless, only a couple were moist and flavorful. We loved the side dishes they brought by though, those were delicious. I couldn't get enough of the plantains. Their salad bar was pretty decent but there could have been more options. They were supposed to bring out a happy birthday dessert but no one ever showed up with it and my boyfriend wanted it to be a surprise so he didn't want to have to remind someone in front of me. We didn't want to be late to the comedy club so we left without getting it. Service was quite slow too, especially when we were done and needed to pay. We were on a time crunch so it got a little frustrating. Overall this place was ok but for the price you pay I would expect all the meats to be moist and full of flavor.

You must forgive me, since I am So Cal, born and bred, and only know soft serve.

Since most of our meals were already planned out, we could only sneak in the custard in between the meals. When we were in line for Pizzeria Bianco, I had asked the second in line's opinion of Culver's and was told they were very good, albeit back in the mid West. They had tried it here, but said the franchises out here did not compare. They said the burgers were good and the custard was a must try.

I decided to forgo the daily flavor and went with the vanilla. It is simply the most divine thing ever! Imagine soft serve, with a silky and creamy texture.

First off we paid $17 for the Caterpillar roll which was massive just like all of their pieces but it definitely did not taste good.

I literally have salmon roll EVERY SINGLE TIME I eat sushi so I would consider myself an expert at what a ""good"" salmom roll is and this one was not.  Usually sushi is meant to eat with one bite but I felt like I was eating a Salmon Sandwich when I ate these rolls...It just was not good at all.

Also the Sashimi was cut in a horrendous fashion with big pieces that were literally cut into squares.  But like I said...

I I've been to discuss some before when it was Kanji and it was absolutely amazing. I have seen really great reviews for this place so I expected more. Only came here for my husband's team dinner so the food was free. I have never been to a all you can eat sushi place and don't think I'd ever try one again. The sushi and everything else besides the fried rice was bland and I mean completely without flavor unless you added soy sauce. The fish tasted like fish there was just nothing special or memorable about anything. Would not go back unless it was another team dinner and would not pay to eat here even if it is all you can eat.,3,3,3

The fact that this hotel is on the strip and NOT considered a low budget cheesy hotel in Las Vegas and part of a decent chain of hotels AND priced much higher than any off the strip budget hotel. You definitely expect MORE.... SUCH A LET DOWN!! First off entering the hotel from the parking garage the elevators are SO confusing. (Even an employee of the hotel had a hard time) The elevator buttons are not labeled, so you are guessing which floor to get off on to get to the hotel entrance floor. Once in the hotel (from parking garage) you are in the gaming\/arcade\/kid zone area. Trying to navigate to find the ""check in"" desk from that area there are no signs for the elevators. There is an escalator... but when you have all your luggage and escalator is NOT going to work. OK so bottom line navigating your way WITH VERY LITTLE SIGNAGE POSTED was difficult. Elevators not clear as to what floor is CASINO or ROOMS...?? Leaves you guessing and frustrated!!! NOW THE ROOM: We booked 2 Queen bed room. It was 3 of us. My mom, sister , and me. This room was SO CRAMPED!! There is this huge wardrobe\/TV\/hutch that takes up almost 1 entire wall. So this thing is to be used as dresser, closet, TV Stand. So there was no other closet in the room. Each of the beds is basically again the wall on either side.  No desk. A chair crammed in a corner, basically useless because it's right between the huge multi purpose wardrobe piece and 1 of the beds.  OK so ROOM: SMALL and NOT comfortably functional.  The TV was intermittent, barely any channels and the channels that were available were not clear and would go out!! Not whole lot of time watching TV but it should be an option. No fridge in the room. No glasses. Not even plastic cups!! We had to go to Walgreens to buy plastic cups. When I called to ask for a couple of cups, I was told it would be $5\/ cup. AN EMPTY CUP!! REALLY???? Looking back I should have ordered a soda from room Service for $8 and used that cup.  No coffee maker. Could not heat up water for tea.  Even HOLIDAY INN offers that complimentary. 
Hard for guests to navigate within the hotel\/elevators. 
VERY crammed room accommodations. 
NO common amenities available (unless you want to pay)
WIFI in rooms was terrible to non existent (probably why the TV reception was soo bad)
Bottom line for the price you pay NOT WORTH IT!! 
Better accommodations at HOLIDAY INN.

HzYE_RslXvzNCS3juwkQpg,nhxboACN_-bFGQHBTAr2DQ,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,5,2013-05-07,"An update is in order for my review of MIX.

First-The manager of the restaurant cared so much about the negative review that he actually tracked me down at work, spoke to me, and insisted that we give the restaurant another try.

I'm glad we did.  I went in with my parents, and we were blown away by the meal and the service we got.   Sebastian, the manager, was terrific.  Bianca, our server, was as good as it gets.

Before people say that we were treated well simply because of a negative review, I will say that I was actually watching the tables around us, and I have to say that everybody seemed to be getting great service!

Now the food-honestly, it was like I was in a different restaurant.  We started with Shrimp cocktail.  This was served in a pretty unique way, more of a small salad with shrimp mixed into it.  At the bottom of the bowl was a horseradish custard.  The dish was outstanding.  My father got a plate of sliced meats of different type (I forgot what it's called) and he loved it.

Because I was unhappy with the Tuna I had for an app last time, we were brought out a portion to try.  Once again, it was like a different dish.  The tuna had a great spice to it, and the veggies underneath were very crisp.  THAT""S what tuna tartare should be like!  It was great.

We also had the Gnocchi appetizer.  Once again-it was outstanding.  Terrific mushrooms, Gnocchi, and vegetables, cooked and seasoned perfectly.  It was delicious.

For mains, we got the Surf and turf (Chicken breast, with lobster), the Bison fillet, and a beef filet.  SImply put, each dish was amazing.  The Bison was so tender you could almost cut it just with a fork.  My dad got the Beef filet, and the fork mashed potatoes.  As soon as the waitress put the potatoes in front of him, I said ""Dad, that looks like a different dish than the potatoes I got last time"". And I was right, because these had seasoning, butter, and were delicious! Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly.

For desert, we had vanilla bean ice cream, the cheesecake, and a ""Deconstructed apple pie"".  We loved every bite.

I've come to realize that any restaurant can have a bad night.  The food and service on the second trip MORE than made up for it.  I will say, I was shocked to hear from the manager after the first visit.  The effort he put in to track me down and be sure we had a great experience was incredible-there should be more restaurant managers like Sebastian here in Vegas.

Not only will I be back again (as will my parents), but we've already relayed this story to several of our friends who are going to be trying MIX.

Thank You!",2,0,1

The restaurant has table and bar seating, but also a lounge area with couches that was big enough to accommodate our large party. We did have to bring in extra chairs but the waitress was kind enough to carry them in. 

We were able to place orders for our drinks. Service was prompt. Since we had a large party, the waitress kept each of our tabs separate.  I didn't know what our plan was as a group - I thought maybe we'd each eat at separate tables and convene later for drinks and a group photo. However, the lounge area worked well for us, so we stayed there he whole time. We all ordered and shared a slew of appetizers. We ordered garlic-Parmesan chicken wings (delicious), buffalo wings (yummy with a nice kick), fried pickles (I did not try these, but my coworkers said they were good), flatbread (it had mozzarella, pesto + tomato = very tasty!), cheese curds (my 1st time ever trying these - very good, like a mozzarella stick), and seasoned French fries (very good, seasoned well)

We paid for our drinks separately but we split the tab on the food, so I'm not sure how much the food cost. However, from the looks of the menu and my share, I'd say the food was extremely affordable. The quality of the food was excellent for the price. I can't wait to go back with just my husband for a sit-down dinner!

For our drinks, I only ordered a ginger ale and orange juice. I had gotten refills 3 times and my total drink tab was only $3, how about that?

The atmosphere is similar to that of any restaurant-bar. There are large-screen TVs all over, including the lounge area. 

Our waitress was Denise, and she was very good. She did a great job with our orders and the tabs. She was helpful in getting us chairs and helped take our group photos - we had to ask her 3 different times because none of us brought a camera and our phones took bad photos LOL. (Sorry, Denise!)

I would recommend Two Bucks for a nice night out with a group of friends.  Great service, great food and very affordable prices.",0,0,1

 Adhering to the philosophy that less is more, similar to local legend California Sandwiches with their veal 'wiches, Nick auf der Mauer aims to do one thing, porchetta, and do it well. Very well.
 
I met up for a New Year's Eve lunch with friends to sample the wares at this tiny spot that's been getting all kinds of great buzz. I won't speak for the other ladies, but I for one can assure you, you can believe the hype.

These porcine bundles of joy are sandwiched between soft and crusty sourdough buns from Portuguese bakery, Caldense. At $5.95 for the basic sandwich, it's a healthy size for most. Seriously guys, the pork. It is juicy, packed with flavour, most notably a lovely garlic note from the marinade, and is studded with the most delightfully crispy bits of skin I've encountered in a while. I ordered the sandwich with mushrooms, but would love to try it with the mild bitterness of rapini next time.

While the star at Porchetta & Co. is obviously the sandwich, you can also partake in a side of soup or roasted potatoes. If you're feeling extra hungry, swear to god, have the potatoes. The only time I've ever encountered a mouthful like them, is what is referred to by select members of my family and friends as ""the potatoes"". One year, I roasted my bird à la Martha Stewart, basted in wine and butter, and placed halved new potatoes under the roasting rack to absorb and cook in the buttery, winey drippings. P&C's potatoes come close to these.

Simply seasoned in salt, pepper and olive oil, the spuds are roasted until golden and simultaneously crispy and fluffy. Potato perfection. I said ""Why not?"" to the offer of truffle sauce to go with them, and would recommend this dressing in a heartbeat. All the flavours in each dish danced together like Bolshoi on my tongue, each performing their role perfectly to make my mouth happy.

Porchetta & Co. are located at 825 Dundas St. W, and are open Tues.-Sat. 11:00am-9:00pm; Sun. 11:00am-4:00pm; closed Mondays. Now, go!

I have been here many, many times over the last 6 weeks and I think I have a good sense of this place.  First all, I have never had a bad server here.  Not once.  I don't know how that's possible, but it's true.  They are always very warm and attentive.  They are around when you need them and leave you alone when you need to carry on a conversation.  A few of them have made some poor menu suggestions, but taste in food is sometimes subjective, so you can't hold that against them.

The decor is really fun!  Modern, but comfortable and definitely not Scottsdale.  The music selection drives me crazy though.  There is never any theme.  One night I'm listening to great oldies and then I'm listening to hair bands from the 80s, and yet another night I'm listening to grunge from the 90s. Pick a theme, or genre, and stick with it.

The food is either very good or very bad (kind of like that old nursery rhyme: ""When she was good, She was very very good, But when she was bad she was horrid!"") Every single taco I have ever had here has been completely inedible, if only because the meat is completely dried out.  I was really bummed too, because they put a yummy fried egg on top, which adds a twist to it.  So, avoid the happy hour tacos.  The crispy brussel sprouts dish should be removed from the menu.  They finely chop the brussel sprouts into confetti and fry them.  The fried bits dissolve in your mouth in a weird way and all you can taste is the oil.  Every once in awhile, you get a big chunk of brussel sprout that wasn't cut into a small bit and ends up frying for a very short period of time (making it raw, hard, and taste like brussel sprouts, which is not a good thing).  All I can say is avoid it; no modification can fix what's wrong with that dish. The deviled eggs are done completely wrong, in my opinion.  Some people love to have tons of yellow egg filling for their deviled eggs.  Others are minimalists.  I'm a proportionalist.  I don't want there to be so much filling that the damn egg tips over (and they do).  I took half the egg off of each and spread it on toast, which was actually pretty good.  Do not get the tasting menu!  At $25, you would think it would be a great deal, but it's only worth $15.  Each ""course"" (that's being generous) is literally only two bites (delicious bites).  I still had to order a meal after I paid all that money for Costco size samples.  I absolutely love the Rosemary's Piglet.  It's a cocktail with pomegranate juice, rosemary syrup, and champagne.  it's heaven!  HOWEVER, they put a HUGE (size of your fist) ice cube with rosemary leaves in the drink, which only allows for a tiny bit of alcohol.  If you order any drink here, make sure you ask for no ice cubes.  The ice cube wastes precious space and is actually big enough to assault your nose or eye.

Moving on, the food that is good is a long list!  The fried chicken is out of this world (the sweet potato biscuit that comes with the fried chicken has been mostly good, but there have been times when it came out hard as a rock--if they made it smaller, this probably wouldn't happen)!  The lamb burger is orgasmic, and even though they gave me a really bad stomach ache from being so rich, the fries are heaven as well.  They have really good happy hour prices for specific drinks and dishes.  I've also never had a bad cocktail here.

I can honestly say my only bad experience was during restaurant week.  Each course took 30 minutes to get.  The manager paid for one of my cocktails, but being there for 2 hours to get an appetizer, salad, dinner, and dessert was a bit painful.  I haven't had that problem since.

So, after a very long review, I would definitely say go and enjoy the place.  The food is unique; there's a neighborhood feel to the crowd and the servers, and minus a few bad eggs on the menu, the food and cocktails are delicious.",2,0,0

We got the Loved acai bowl and it was yummy although the drizzle of honey on top was a little bit heavy handed. It's definitely a great breakfast that is a healthy choice!

Hopeful poke bowl consisted of black rice as the base and salmon as the protein. The salmon was fresh but it was a small portion in the bowl. The black rice gives it a different texture than other poke bowls which was not bad - different though. The overall flavours is good. It is more on the spicy side for me with the jalapenos and sriracha aioli. The poke bowl is a smaller portion than other poke places with a relatively similar price.

Overall it is a good place for healthy alternatives and friendly service. I'd skip the poke bowl and try it somewhere else. It is on the pricey side but their smoothies and acai bowls are worth a try",1,1,1

When I went for lunch, the atmosphere was very relaxed, and the bartender was very attentive.  Same goes for breakfast, even though it was much busier during the breakfast visit (I overheard a server saying they're busiest during the breakfast times).

For breakfast, I went with a tried and true, biscuits and gravy, which comes with 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, and potatoes.  My server asked me if I wanted some chorizo on my potatoes, which was unexpected, but later I saw that their lunch special was tacos with chorizo.  I probably should have steered clear of the chorizo, as it was a bit much, but I didn't look at the special board before I came in.  For those who like extras though, it was nice that he offered and didn't charge for it.  The biscuits were slightly disappointing, I'm sad to report.  They had a good flavor, but they were a little overbaked to the point where they were almost hard.  Also, the parts that didn't have gravy on them actually tasted of slightly burned biscuit.  :(  This saddened me, but didn't take away from the meal too much.

When I went for lunch the previous week, I got the grilled chicken sandwich, which comes with bacon on it and avocado.  The sandwich tasted awesome!  This time, the only downside was a matter of mechanics.  The bacon\/avocado would not stay between the bun (which was a bacon focaccia, I believe... yum!) when I'd bite into it.  Not that big of a deal.  I mean, the sandwich fillings were hefty!

In DeKalb Illinois they didn't have Garretts so I was so bummed but they had a non name brand mom and pop popcorn store.  Their popcorn was pure heaven!  The quality popcorn is a Midwest thing.  In California they didn't have quality popcorn like Garretts.  But in Chicago it's only a stone throw away from Wisconsin which has better cheese then California.  It's just not as well advertised on the west coast.  They use the finest cheese in the States to make popcorn like Garretts.  That's part of the reason why it's so good.  The other factor is freshness and the skill to make quality popcorn.  Store bought popcorn from Albertsons will never be as good because it sits too long on a shelf.  Loaded with preservatives.

The man asked for here or to go and I said to go which were different sizes I guess. I picked the middle container for $11.00 roughly. He could put three flavors in it. He had me try a few flavors and i really liked the pistachio so I chose that one for my container. My other two picks were a shot in the dark because I had reached my sample allotment before finding another that I really loved. I chose amaretto and Toblerone. He packaged it up, I paid and went along my way. Got home and tried each. Very happy with my choices. The amaretto was very tasty and just how I imagined it would taste.

Although in a strip mall, the interior of this restaurant will surprise you by its upscale contemporary look and feel, very pleasant!
The staff was attentive, friendly and professional, but not intrusive.  One must understand that they will pretty much customize the dishes to your taste or health desires.  They won't put peanuts in any dish unless you request it.  The degree of spiciness also needs to be addressed if important to you.  
We started our meal with Tom Yum Thai soup for two people.  You actually got enough for three bowls and glad I am!  This soup was better than any Tom Yum Thai soup I had eaten in Bangkok (we ate this soup in Thailand 8 or 9 times, the year before last).  The degree of spiciness was perfect, flavors strong and the ingredients plentiful and definitely fresh.  Sorry to go on like this but this soup is my favorite, I even learned to make it in a Thai cooking school while there on vacation.  Next came refreshing Chicken Lettuce Wraps, 4 large crunchy iceberg lettuce leaves, with a side of plum sauce and a plate of the delicious chicken and vegetable filling.  The true gem of the meal followed with one of their specials, Kung Pao 3 Seas.  Over flowing with plump shrimp and delicate scallops, the ""kicker"" was pieces of Tilapia fried in an unusual and very tasty breading, all immersed in the Kung Pao sauce, crunchy sweet onions and green pepper chunks in a spicy but not burning sauce, peanuts added at our request.  Next came the Firecracker Shrimp that couldn't match up to the fabulous flavor and heat of the Kung Pao dish.  It did have twice as many shrimp as I had expected, and had a fresh taste.  Perhaps if we had this dish on a different evening, without the Kung Pao, it would have been judged differently.  For dessert we were given a free sample of a miniature ""egg roll"" filled with banana and chocolate, deep fried and covered in powdered sugar.  Then followed the ubiquitous fortune cookies and almond cookies as well.
We will return to eventually sample the full menu!",1,0,0

I wasn't sure what kind of meat to pick, so I did half kahlua pig & half steak. I liked them both, but I'm also glad that I did half and half because I feel like too much of either and I would've felt sick. For the meats you have a choice of their huli huli chicken, kalua pig, pulehu steak, grilled fish or grilled veggie.. then your choice of rice\/beans\/cabbage\/lettuce\/veggies. I picked the seaweed rice which I absolutely loved. I can't decide if I like Chipotle's cilantro rice or Braddah's seaweed rice better! For salsa, you have the choice of a mild charred pineapple verde, medium mango & roasted corn, or spicy tomato with grilled maui onion. I had the mild pineapple verde and my friend had the medium mango & charred corn... both of us decided that the salsas were on the sweet side (not really a fan). I did order the roasted sesame gingerette dressing on the side (they also have a papaya buttermilk ranch), and normally I love anything sesame, but I wasn't crazy for this dressing. 

I added cheese and guacamole on top... love cheese so that was obligatory. The guac... I prefer the guac from chipotle! It wasn't bad here, I just wouldn't order it again as there just wasn't much happening in terms of flavor. 

They have canned Hawaiian Sun drinks here.. I had the green tea with ginseng. This stuff was so good! It tasted more like a juice, but it was still really good. Now I just need to find out where I can buy these little gems!

Overall, I would probably come back.. but not on the regular like some of my yelp friends. It is good, not GREAT or anything aaaahmazzzing... but not bad\/terrible either.",2,1,1

After posting to Yelp, I received an email from Moondoggies within one hour stating they were going to rescind the adoption based on my negative feedback. I in turn told them to go pound sand. Amazing to me that after a week of no communication, I get instant feedback from them. Not only that, they didn't even want to resolve the problem, just wanted the dog back. 

Another issue, the dog was not microchipped! This was stated in someone else's review and to date, I've still not received my contract or any further documentation. I guess that's because I got an attorney and let them know that. Since then, not a peep. I also contacted petfinder and they called me back asking for more details. Apparently, they've received many complaints about these guys. The city of Long Beach also has an ongoing investigation into them as well for the same issues. I'm pretty certain they won't be in business very much longer. 

We're grateful that we got my pup, I only hope it was a rescue and not from some puppy mill. I can't believe a word these guys state any more, so I really have no idea.

But wow, there was a great selection of desserts including ice cream, crepe station, cakes, cake pops, cupcakes, etc etc. the list can just go on forever! They also had taco station, soups, salads, and even guava juice!!! Oh! And the waiter even brought me over this peach green tea .... AMAZING! I kept ordering this over & over again.

I would have to say that they get really busy so you might not get as much attention from the servers as you want, but just be patient!

Aside from that, I was full within 2-3 plates but I kept forcing myself to eat more because they had soooo much selection! My favorite was the shrimp cocktail, king crab legs, and all the stations that they had. crepes were good but a little bit too sweet for my taste and also cause they don't use fresh strawberries. they used the can kind :(

We chose to sit on the large patio at a table by their fire pit.  It was cold outside but witnessing five tall heaters we thought we would be comfortable.  The waitress and service was lack luster!! We constantly had to chase our gal down and ask to get our heaters lit.  The busboy would come and light one.... it would go out, chase down waitress again to get another heater that works, busboy would return roll one away, roll another in its place, light it and two minutes later it would go out. A mean game of ""Ground hog day"" four times later the bus boy has depleted his options and goes to get a cart filled with FULL propane.

In the meantime we are very cold and waiting what seems like forever to place our food and then to receive it.

The steak appetizer was extremely rare and very chewy, however the mussels were delicious in a great broth (not enough bread for dipping).  Due to our chose to sit outside (waiting on heaters) our food became very good quickly.

The visual ambiance is great! They have a large tv on the patio playing old movies (80's and 90's) with a great fire pit. However loud horrible rap (new and old)music blaring over top of you.

We stopped short with just appetizers and decided to leave.  Perhaps if you are a young hipster the place would be cool but I will not be racing back to their limited menu and slow \/poor service.

Foot note..... the young generation seems to lack the true skill of being a great server! They seem to be slow, spacy and disengaged.  Sad really.... when you see so many amazing restaurants opening up!

Upon arrival, we were told we were upgraded to a penthouse as our one bedroom suite was unavailable.  We did find it odd that the ""penthouse"" was on the 25th floor...in a 61 floor hotel.  It also didn't match any of the floor plans that represented penthouses.  Oh well.  It was still better than the room we were booked for.  

And it was NICE.  I would live there if I could afford it.  But I would upgrade the furniture, as the couch in the living room is designed for interrogation rooms.  The bed though...oh yes.  I am THE pickiest man on Earth when it comes to beds and my only complaint was ""well, it is a bit too firm.""  I slept.  I never sleep in Vegas unless it's on the couch.  And if you like the bed, you can actually buy it from them and it's pretty reasonable in cost.

The bathroom was just amazing.  His and her vanities with separate bath amenities.  Awesome tub.  High-speed toilet with heated seat and bidet functions.  Just fantastic.

The worst?  The aforementioned couch was a medieval torture device.  The vaunted touch screen control for all the room's curtains, lighting, etc. was ATTACHED at the night stand.  Not exactly the high-tech solution when you're anywhere but on one side of the bed.  Oh, and the television, which controls EVERYTHING, went out for several hours.  Thanks a lot for that.

Customer service was generally awesome, from the front desk to the housekeeping.  The lounge was a little over-named, as it's just a couple couches and tables thrown in a lobby.  If you want a real concierge lounge try Palazzo.  But they do serve snacks for most of the day and there is water, juice, soda, etc. available pretty much 24 hours.  Ever come back to the room at midnight and wish you had a Coke but don't want to pay three bucks at the all-night store?  Hit the lounge.

My biggest complaint with the Sky Suites is that you get a private entrance...which is a pain in the behind to get to if you don't come by limo (which is complimentary to and from the airport).  They have a special entrance for that, but if you drive into town like we did and go to the valet, you get to lug your stuff halfway across creation to get to the registration desk.  It would be nice if they had a drive up entrance for Sky Suites...or a shuttle!  Oh, and the buffet is far overpriced for what you get and the casino feels like an afterthought.

We hit Vegas several times a year and generally, the Four Seasons is our favorite by far, but Aria Sky Suites is a very close second, and in some ways it's actually better.  Four Seasons is quieter and has better (just barely) service, but Sky Suites has much more comfortable beds and that lounge with its drink supply is a Godsend.

If you don't mind some minor niggles, Aria Sky Suites is a pretty decent place for the price for sure.",5,3,2

You enter through the back, and go through the kitchen where kitchen staff are friendly, clean and hard at work.  Dining area has Mafioso décor and intimate table settings (as well as not-so-intimate larger table settings for groups).  They have a nice wine selection, and help you pair up the right wine with your food.  COME HUNGRY!! They give nice, ample portions!

For our appetizer, we got Fresh Oysters on the Half-Shell and Crab Cake with Chipotle Aioli.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!!  Very fresh, savory and delicious!  I wish they sold bottles of their Chipotle Aioli sauce.  I would drizzle that on everything!! 

We got the prime rib, which was cooked and seasoned to perfection!!  Their au jus is heavenly, and their horseradish is creamy but not too spicy.  Their Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes is their signature side dish with their prime rib.  I can see why.  It pairs beautifully!!  My dinner companion had their stuffed baked potatoes, which looked to be a meal in and of itself!!  

Not a steak fan?  Durant's also has a nice chicken, seafood and liver (yes, liver) menu.  

The prime rib leftovers are even better the next day with some over-easy fried eggs!  Durant's will also fill sauce containers with their dressings\/sauces to take home so you have even more than you got with your dinner!  

I highly recommend Durant's for an intimate romantic dinner free from kids or noise.  It's also great for large groups from work, family or a special event for friends!  I will definitely return.  I wish I had tried this place years ago!!  I have been missing out!!

So why three stars? Two things, the service was abysmal and the menu was underwhelming for what you pay for. 

Service (Grade: F)

Our dinner at L'Atelier was a testament to the importance of good, prompt service and conversely how poor service can destroy a generally well-executed meal in terms of cooking. 

They started out well by being very attentive but this was easy enough as we were the absolute first and only party for dinner. However, service got progressively worse as they siphoned off the wait staff to attend to later arriving parties. At a restaurant with the reputation that comes along with being associated with Joel Robuchon, I found it unacceptable that we had to wait hours and hours for our mains, dessert, etc. The coup de grace was that they had to be reminded that our dinner was to celebrate a birthday even though this was expressed in the reservation and had been told to two separate waiters. 

You just can't forget about a birthday dinner party, especially when the restaurant was not particularly swamped that night, just so you can favor other parties. That kind of chosen neglect was inexplicably rude.

Food (Grade: B)

L'Atelier's prix fixe menus are renowned because they give you several options. Some come with supplemental charges of $10 or more but those are generally the options that are better. 

The amuse bouche of foie gras parfait with a port wine reduction and a Parmesan foam was hit or miss. Half of us liked it the other half didn't finish the tiny shot. 

The Les Pates (supp. charge): lobster chunks over orecchiette was probably one of the better mains. On the other hand, the supplemental charge on the Le Veau (veal ravioli) was not worth it as the dish was bland. 

The La Dorade: snapper carpaccio with lemon glaze was probably the best of the appetizers. However, the La Tomate (chilled tomato gazpacho with burratta) was too salty and felt like drinking marinara sauce straight.

If you're opting for the pre-theater prix fixe menu, the roast of the day (8\/9\/14) was the free range chicken and it was just okay. 

The desserts were of course beautiful to look at but were not especially noteworthy in terms of flavor. 

Overall, I was expecting something on par with a restaurant like Providence which also has comparably priced prix fixe menus. However, L'Atelier was underwhelming throughout. There are some good dishes but many were weighed down by bad service. Even without considering the service, the food itself did not meet the high expectations and I don't think that was for lack of choosing the ""right"" dishes. We asked our waiter for suggestions and with four in our party we were able to try a broad swath of dishes. Nevertheless, I wouldn't be able to in good faith give a good review because like one in our party said: ""you don't pay a lot to get ignored.",21,10,10
RGh--qLkUG7d_V_ucCz8qw,tWBLn4k1M7PLBtAtwAg73g,ZnxudK5ExgpfXs4bicS4IA,3,2011-10-19,"This place is becoming a lunchtime favourite since I've started working in the area, but lets start by getting out of the way the fact that this place is in Flemingdon Park, and is much like all the restaurants in this little strip mall. We're talking no frills type eating. If you want a nice dining environment or even well maintained bathrooms, you're in the wrong part of town. But if you're looking for some quick and cheap for take out, this is a gem of a spot. 

There are always good specials and most have pictures in the place to help with the selection process. Most meals are a combination of meat with a bit of veggies over rice or noodles or sorts. I've had the chicken curry on steamed rice, the szechuan chicken over fried rice, and today the Singapore curried rice noodle with shrimp and pork (minus the shrimp on request).
The curry is a little bland and generic yellow curry but with some hot sauce thrown in was pretty good. The szechaun chicken had a good level of spice but a really nice flavour to it. Not just spice for the sake of being spicy. The Singapore curried rice noodle was delicious. Again, limited spice in the curry but the rice noodle and bean sprouts and veggies all mixed up worked very well together.

Each meal has cost in the $5 to $6.25 ballpark after tax, and was a hefty amount of food which in the case of the chicken rice combo's, I was actually able to have enough leftovers for leftovers! All in all, for cheap and quick food with good portions and decent flavours, this place is certainly worth a try if you're in the neighbourhood.",2,0,0

The breakfast sandwich was good--the brioche bun definitely took it up a notch, but the egg seemed artificial to me in its folded-sheet style. The side of hashbrowns was okay.

The French toast combo was enormous, consisting of one dish of four slices of French toast and another dish of eggs, bacon, and more hashbrowns, if I remember correctly.

the time at lunch, it's decent and it went along way especially when you are given only 5 bucks a day for lunch money.

It's a beautiful place and my initial impression was very good - but I unfortunately received the worst tattoo of my life there. My tattoo artist, who goes by JP, had no finesse and didn't seem to care at all about the work. He dug so hard into my skin that I actually had a huge chunk missing and was lucky I didn't get an infection. He didn't even wrap my tattoo, even though it was bleeding everywhere.

I've since had to get my tattoo redone and my new artist was shocked at the poor job. I had a lot of scar tissue from the initial tattoo, so I was really lucky the color took the second time around. She warned me that King Ink is banking on customers who are willing to pay A LOT for the experience - then be back in their hometow left unable to complain about the shoddy work. Given that it's Vegas, they're counting on you giving them money and getting out of town, which leads their accountability to be extremely low.

To their credit, the portions were enormous and everyone at the table was happy with their order. We had the Trash Can Nachos and be warned - you may not be able to finish your main course after this appetizer. Overall it was great visit with reasonable Strip prices.

Aside from the fact that it's nestled in downtown Las Vegas, where all the strangest people are about, this place was pretty damn good. We ordered Gorgonzola fries and spicy calamari to start. The sauce on the fries was out of this world. The spicy calamari was just that...spicy. Be prepared. But still pretty good. 

For Pizza: we ordered ""The Butcher"" and ""Ned Itty"" (possibly the correct name). The Butcher was honestly, just average. But the Ned was excellent. Garlicky. Spinach. Ricotta. Very very good. 

Environment: meh, sub par. It was a mix of a diner and those old pizza places you would go to as a kid. For $20+ a pie, they could have classed this place up just a wee bit. Also, as I usually will mention, it was loud. Loud music and loud people. Be prepared!

V_Qt67y6WhVxoUNpxiNpyA,JPC8NY6CxZ4owuixmkd3Kw,zhqurYCKYSCZmIEtus1Mzw,1,2016-09-06,"I bought my car here about two and a half years ago. Part of what sold me on the car was the promise of excellent service and customer support with my vehicle as long as I had the car. Prestige Jeep has failed miserably on that promise. In a past appointment for an oil change, I never received a call to tell me my vehicle was ready for pick-up, so I called myself soon before closing. On the phone, they said ""Your car has been ready."" Interesting, because I never got a phone call, which I was told that I would. So I went to pick up my car, and waited another 90 minutes for them to bring my car around. Different people came to check my paperwork claiming that they could not find my car. An hour and a half later, my car was finally brought around for me to leave. As irritating as that was, that situation is not the reason for this one-star review.

I went to start my car this weekend, and it wouldn't start. . . Nothing at all. So, I got the car jumped and started and nothing on the interior works that is controlled through the touch screen. . . No air, radio, etc. I tried driving the car around, but once you cut the car off, it will not turn back on without a jump. I called Jeep and told them the situation and they said the earliest they would see my car is September 29th. . . Almost four weeks from now! I explained that my car is still under warranty and I cannot be without a vehicle for nearly a month, and they still said the earliest they would look at it is September 29th. What am I supposed to do without a car between now and then??? I have left a message for the manager with the receptionist, and I called back today and asked to be transferred to leave a message on the manager's voicemail; I have not heard back yet.

Overall, to say that I am disappointed with the service at Prestige Jeep would be a hyperbolic understatement. At this point, as much as I love my actual car, I regret purchasing my vehicle there. I would never recommend anyone to purchase a vehicle from this location, based solely on the disregard and poor customer care that has been exhibited since owning my vehicle.",0,0,0

The thing is, it's been such a long time since I last went, I don't really remember what it is. But it's something that has stuck in my mind for years and I avoided the place like the plague. Was it bad service? Reading other people's reviews, that could be it.

Anyway, I finally returned this evening to hang out with a friend. We didn't order anything demanding - just a couple of drinks. The waitress took our order quickly, the drinks came out in good time, and then they left us alone as we talked for a couple of hours. When it was time to leave, it was easy enough to flag the waitress down, get the check, and be on our way.

Other people have mentioned that their service has vastly improved. I'll second that. It certainly was fast, accurate, and then invisible when we didn't need them.

The desks all have outlets to plug in your laptop and other electronic devices. Comfortable chairs. There were more tables at the back of the room for coffee, lunch breaks, and the like. The walls have inspiring murals. The wifi is fast as well. The facility was donated to the community by Switch Founder & CEO, Rob Roy. 

There is a monthly membership fee, it includes access to the facility, co-working space, offices and other amenities. More info on their website. 

It's a great space to check out if you are interested in creating your own startup and\/or want to get involved in the tech scene. They have meetups and other events going on throughout the year. Such as Hour of Code. Check out their website for events & schedule.

Plus, I've been trying to eat healthier, and that's not necessarily easy on the wallet, either. 

So I went to Reiders Market in Painesville because I've heard from multiple people that the produce is local, fresh and inexpensive and that you can get good deals on protein.  I was not disappointed.  

The produce selection was great.  I picked up some fresh zucchini, green beans, carrots, you name it, Reiders had it.  I was also able to get some delicious, pre-seasoned flank steak and chicken breast, which are great for throwing on the grill after work.  Reiders also has a large prepared foods section, so if you're not into cooking, you can still pick up some tasty eats.  And its bakery is to-die-for; so if you need to satisfy your craving for something sweet, Reiders is the place for you.

My only complaint with Reiders is that its lacking the selection of pantry items and drinks I usually buy at the grocery store -- when your fiance will only drink blue and red G2s and eat very specific brands\/kinds of yogurt, bread, etc., markets like Reiders aren't a one-stop-shop like the larger supermarkets.

Leider waren schon die ersten Minuten im Restaurant nur negativ. Unfassbar unfreundliche Bedienung, die einem von Anfang an schon den Appetit mit ihrer schlechten Laune verdirbt. Schade! Das Ambiente ist ganz nett, die Tische und das Besteck immerhin sauber. Die Bestellung wurde genau so unsympathisch aufgenommen, wie auch ca. 15 min später das Essen serviert wurde. Der Burger hat an einigen Stellen leicht ""verdorben"" geschmeckt, weshalb man allgemein die Lust am essen verlor. Ansonsten sah der Salat etc. auf dem Burger frisch aus. Nachdem die herzliche Mitarbeiterin den Tisch abgeräumt hatte und ich den mysteriösen Geschmack des Burgerfleisches erwähnte, rollte sie nur mit den Augen und verließ wortlos den Tisch (Mit ihr die Aussicht auf ein Trinkgeld) Beim bezahlen erschlich sie sich jenes jedoch, indem sie einfach weniger Rückgeld gab.

But, reviews were right service sucked. Had to keep asking for dishes that were missing in our order. Ice cream is not ayce, two scoops per person max. Otherwise, you get a lecture about how they aren't suppose to give you more than one order (if you ask for seconds). We had a table of six, so getting in and out wasn't easy to grab sauces and drinks all the time. Cups were too small so my brother kept getting refills for the table cause he sat at the end. Boyfriend asked for a pitcher of water to make it easier, but they refused to give it to us because it was reserved for people who order beer. We all did get our own pot which is nice. I have a food allergy, so it's nice that I didn't have to share the soup with someone else. It does get really hot in the restaurant, as there is no ventilation above the table. There was only two soups available, clear or spicy and we didn't have to pay extra for the fancier soups since it wasn't offered. Also, price on site said it as $19.99 but when we got there the menu said $20.99. Not a big deal, but it was kind of a shady move. Try it for yourself at least once if you're interested. I may go back since I live downtown and there isn't a huge selection of hot pot places around here.",0,0,0

This bar has been around forever, and has been attracting all kinds for just as long. It's in the village, which means the clientele is predominantly of the LGBT persuasion. But, as most bars in the village are, this one is welcoming to everyone, including the occasional bachelorette party. Everyone in this bar (at least on weekends) is there to drink, laugh, have fun, and maybe sing a little, so in general the vibe is really happy. 

My partner convinced me to take a star away for the drinks...while they are reasonably  priced, I was reminded that they were a bit small...our waitress, however, kept them coming with a smile and sometimes a little singalong 

Where it loses the two stars is for decor...it's very dated, some might say a little grungy. It makes it dark and, if not filled with drunken, screaming bachelorettes, can feel a little seedy. I would recommend this place on a Friday or Saturday, if you want a full audience for your Karaoke-ing.",1,2,1

I used the dolce salon the last time I was in town to get my hair cut since I have trouble finding the time while I'm at home.  I really liked the place, they were accommodating to my situation and the stylist that I had was great.  I really liked the cut she gave me, and she gave me a few tips on styling that I hadn't thought of before.  I expected to pay a bit more but it was just as much as I pay at home for a smaller salon (although my salon is nice too, and not too high end 'expensive'.)  

I will definitely go again if I have trouble finding time to get an appointment at home.  I still prefer my 'home' salon but dolce is a great alternative.  I really want to try their facials or get a pedicure next time I'm in town!",3,0,3

The place was nice, and there was a pretty decent happy hour menu so we decided to dine-in.  After ordering our rolls, we decided that we should just do the AYCE buffet.  I would've thought it would have been easy to accomodate since the rolls we ordered were from the all you can eat menu, but they said they wouldn't do it because it's their rule.  However, I was asked, ""Why don't you just order some more sushi.  It's not that expensive.""  I'm not sure how the waitress can go about determining what's expensive for a person anyways.

Beside that point, the sushi was just decent.  The happy hour is a good price, but the sushi was average at best.  The ambience was nice.  I would have given this place 3 stars, but because of the waitress comment and the rolling of the eyes when I asked if they were able to change it to AYCE, I had to bring it down to 2 stars.",2,1,1

While the service is always quite slow and everything can take forever, the food is awesome.  They make everything from scratch and use ingredients of killer quality. I've never had a dish that I didn't completely enjoy.

My favorite is likely the white flannel. It is a corned beef hash (sliced corned beef) with garlic, mushrooms and sour cream. This dish is my absolute favorite breakfast in the state. Love it. And the ladies in the family are also extremely passionate about the green flannel. Another corned beef hash version with jalapeños. Quite tasty but too much for my sissy tongue.

As far as lunch, they have excellent burgers but the Loki always comes to mind. The Loki is a corned beef sandwich with these amazing pickled onions and slices of jalapeños. It's almost on the edge of too hot for my sissy tongue. In fact it is too hot. It's just so dang tasty that I force myself through the pain though. So many other great sandwiches as well. I even love the way they slice their chicken for sandwiches. While not in my wheelhouse, the Mrs. just loves their veggie dishes as well.  

Then my favorite drink is the coffee soda. This is absolutely amazing. They make their own espresso syrup. I've been told it takes 40 shots of espresso and then they reduce it. They add this to soda water and you can add other things like cream, vanilla syrup, etc. I have a definite sweet tooth so I always go cream and vanilla syrup. It is a great combination of soda, intense espresso flavor and sweetness. I can't get enough of this. 

The coffees, lattes, etc. are also excellent. They have a great microbrew list and a killer selection of boutique root beer. 

My big piece of information is that you don't want to go here if you're in a hurry. If you have nowhere to go and you can settle in & hang out, it's tough to beat OT for breakfast or lunch.",4,2,2

Just like everybody else, i had a great experience with this chapel. When you mention ""vegas wedding,"" some people would think trashy and unclassy, but this chapel beats that stigma, from the main office\/waiting area, to the chapels, the outdoor gazebo, to the photography studio, and everyone that works here. We had an intimate outdoor gazebo wedding that was officiated by reverend Joel and he was great! The ceremony photographer Wilma took high quality photos, and the studio photographer Ashlynn was the most professional and nicest photographer that i've ever worked with and i also love the pictures that she took. For the price that we paid, the quality of our pictures, the ceremony itself, and our overall experience was a million times better than i had ever hoped for. I just hope this chapel is working on their website because everything in there is outdated, except maybe for the wedding packages and pricing, but the pictures of the chapels, and the samples of the studio portraits do not do their chapel justice in my opinion. Just a tip: be prepared to also have cash to tip the photographer. When they sent me an email of the confirmation of my wedding along with the invoice, i was only told to prepare a tip for the minister. So when they asked us to tip the photographer as well (which she very well deserved) my husband and i felt bad that we only had a small amount of cash left in our wallets because we werent prepared for it. I just hope that my review would help their business become more well-known because they really deserved it. They made our wedding day so special and I just want to return the favor by encouraging other couples to pick this chapel for their wedding. Just trust me when I say that you won't regret it! :D",2,1,1
